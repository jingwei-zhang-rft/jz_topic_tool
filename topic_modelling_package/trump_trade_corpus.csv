    LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, who
has garnered a large following on social media with rambunctious
postings, said he sometimes tweets from bed, though he
occasionally allows others to post his words.
    Trump frequently uses Twitter to announce policy, assail his
adversaries and to tangle with countries, including North Korea,
over world affairs. The @realDonaldTrump account had 47.2
million users as of Sunday. 
    In an interview with Britain's ITV channel, he appeared to
appreciate the wide impact of his postings in Twitter and said
that he needed social media to communicate with voters in the
era of what he termed fake news.
    ""If I don't have that form of communication I can't defend
myself,"" Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday. ""I get
a lot of fake news, a lot of news that is very false or made
up.""
    It was a crazy situation, he said, that many people in the
world waited for his tweets. He usually tweets himself,
sometimes from bed.
    When asked about whether he was lying in bed with his phone
thinking of how to wind people up, Trump said: ""Well, perhaps
sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or 
whatever, but generally speaking during the early morning, or
during the evening I can do whatever, but I am very busy during
the day, very long hours. I am busy.""
    ""I will sometimes just dictate out something really quickly
and give it to one of my people to put it on,"" he said.
    Asked about eating burgers and drinking Coke, Trump, 71,
said: ""I eat fine food, really from some of the finest chefs in
the world, I eat healthy food, I also have some of that food on
occasion... I think I eat actually quite well.""
    Trump said that he was very popular in the United Kingdom.
Some British politicians have called for Trump not to visit and
1.86 million people have signed a petition asking for him to be
banned from entering the United Kingdom.
    ""I get so much fan mail from people in your country - they
love my sense of security, they love what I am saying about many
different things,"" Trump said.

    Trump would take a ""tougher"" approach to Brexit negotiations
than British Prime Minister Theresa May. [nL8N1PN0AC]
    When asked if May was in a ""good position"" regarding the
ongoing Brexit talks, Trump replied: ""Would it be the way I
negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate it the way it's [being]
negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude.""
    Pressed on how his approach would be different, he said: ""I
would have said the European Union is not cracked up to what
it's supposed to be. I would have taken a tougher stand in
getting out.""
    He said the United States would do a post-Brexit trade deal
with the United Kingdom.
    He was pressed on how some women opposed him and he said he
supported women and that many women understood that.
    Trump said women in particular liked his support for a
strong military as they often wanted to feel safe at home.
    ""There's nobody better than me on the military... I think
women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home,""
Trump said. ""I have tremendous respect for women.""
    ""No, I wouldn't say I am a feminist. I mean, I think that
would be maybe going too far: I am for women, I am for men, I am
for everyone.""
    He said French President Emmanuel Macron was a friend and
that he liked him a lot.

    By Steve Holland
    WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump
arrived in Switzerland on Thursday to attend the World Economic
Forum where he will push his ""America First"" agenda and seek
more fair, reciprocal trade between the United States and its
allies.
    Trump arrived in Zurich en route to the Swiss ski resort of
Davos for two days of events culminating in a speech on Friday
to the forum of business and political leaders.
    Trump, never invited as a businessman, will be the first
U.S. president to attend Davos since Bill Clinton in 2000,
giving him a chance to mingle with the same elite ""globalists""
he bashed in the 2016 election campaign.
    ""Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the
world how great America is and is doing,"" Trump tweeted before
departure. ""Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing,
will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again!""
    White House aides said Trump's message would be the same
that he has given during other trips aboard over the past year:
The United States wants strong ties with its allies but wants to
reduce chronic trade deficits with many of them.
    ""America first is not America alone,"" said White House
senior economic adviser Gary Cohn, who is traveling with Trump.
""When we grow, the world grows; when the world grows, we grow.
We're part of it, and we're part of a world economy. And the
president believes that.""
    In the run-up to his trip to Davos, Trump slapped a 30
percent tariff on imported solar panels, among the first
unilateral trade restrictions imposed by the administration as
part of a broader protectionist agenda. [nL2N1PI2EY]
    Then on Wednesday in Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin said he welcomed a weakening in the dollar. Fears of
protectionist trade policies by the United States had already
pushed the greenback to a three-year low, and Mnuchin's remark
pushed it down further. [nL2N1PJ1CI]
    Trump will use his trip for some diplomacy. He has meetings
with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and Rwandan President
Paul Kagame, current chairman of the African Union, and Swiss
President Alain Berset on Friday.
    Kagame is a pro-American leader who went to the United
States for training when he was in the Ugandan army.
    Iran's growing influence in the Middle East, North Korea's
nuclear challenge and the battle against Islamic State militants
figured to be prominent topics of his meetings.
    French President Emmanuel Macron told RTS channel that he
had ""strongly recommended"" to Trump to attend the Davos forum
during a recent phone conversation they had on Iran ... ""because
I think it's a good thing for President Trump to explain his
strategy for the U.S. and the world here in Davos.
    ""And that he encounters some form of confrontation and
dialogue,"" Macron said.
    Trump will host a small dinner for European business
executives on Thursday night.
    There is broad concern in European capitals that 2018 could
be the year Trump's bark on trade turns into bite, as he
considers punitive measures on steel and threatens to end the
90s-era North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and
Mexico.
    Trump will appeal for increased global investment in the
United States to take advantage of corporate tax cuts approved
by Congress late in 2017 and Trump's deregulatory policies.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
will extend sanctions relief granted to Iran under its 2015
nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers,
leaving the accord intact for now, according to a person
familiar with the decision.
    However, Trump, who has vowed to scrap the pact, was
expected to give the U.S. Congress and European allies a
deadline for improving it, the person said. Without
improvements, Trump would renew his threat to withdraw from the
agreement.
    Trump had faced a Friday deadline to decide on whether to
waive the sanctions. A decision to withhold a waiver would have
effectively ended the deal that put limits on Iran's nuclear
program.
    The White House is expected to announce the decision on
Friday.
    While Trump approved a sanctions waiver, he also decided to
impose new, targeted sanctions on Iran, the person said.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
will be entering something of a lion's den when he visits the
elitist enclave of Davos next week, rubbing shoulders with the
same ""globalists"" that he campaigned against in winning the 2016
election.
    Aides said some of Trump's advisers had argued against him
attending the World Economic Forum in order to steer clear of
the event, which brings together political leaders, CEOs and top
bankers. 
    But in the end, they said, Trump, the first sitting U.S.
president to attend the forum since Bill Clinton in 2000, wanted
to go to call attention to growth in the U.S. economy and the
soaring stock market.
    A senior administration official said Trump is expected to
take a double-edged message to the forum in Switzerland, where
he is to deliver a speech and meet some world leaders.
    In his speech, Trump is expected to urge the world to invest
in the United States to take advantage of his deregulatory and
tax cut policies, stress his ""America First"" agenda and call for
fairer, more reciprocal trade, the official said.
    During his 2016 election campaign, Trump blamed
globalization for ravaging American manufacturing jobs as
companies sought to reduce labor costs by relocating to Mexico
and elsewhere.
    ""Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to
politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our
workers with nothing but poverty and heartache,"" he said on June
28, 2016, in Pennsylvania.
    Trump retains the same anti-globalist beliefs but has
struggled to rewrite trade deals that he sees as benefiting
other countries.
    Trump will be speaking two days after German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in Davos.
    Both ardent defenders of multilateralism and liberal
democratic values, they are expected to lay out the
counter-argument to Trump’s ""America First"" policies. Merkel and
Macron have lobbied Trump hard to keep the United States in the
Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear pact, only for him to
distance himself from those deals.
    There is acute concern in European capitals that 2018 could
be the year Trump’s bark on trade turns into bite, as he
considers punitive measures on steel and threatens to end the
90s-era North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and
Mexico. 
    He has backed off withdrawing from a U.S. trade agreement
with South Korea and while he has threatened to terminate NAFTA,
he has yet to do so.
    Trump’s tax cuts are a source of concern in Europe, where
policymakers are discussing steps to extract more tax dollars
out of U.S. multinationals such as Google and Amazon. European
governments now fear a ""race to the bottom"" on corporate tax
rates and a shift to more investment in the United States by
some of their big companies.
    In a Reuters interview on Thursday, Trump lamented that it
is rare that he meets the leader of a foreign country that has a
trade deficit with the United States. [nL1N1PD08W]
    Based on official data for the year to November, China
exported goods worth $461 billion and the United States ran a
trade deficit of $344 billion. Trump said he would be announcing
some kind of action against China over trade. He is to discuss
the issue during his State of the Union address to the U.S.
Congress on Jan. 30.  
    Asked about the potential for a trade war with China
depending on U.S. action over steel, aluminum and solar panels,
Trump said he hoped a trade war would not ensue.
    ""I don't think so, I hope not. But if there is, there is,""
he said.
    Trump and the U.S. Congress are racing to meet a midnight
Friday deadline to pass a short-term bill to keep the U.S.
government open and prevent agencies from shutdown. [nL1N1PE0H4]
    But if a government shutdown does occur and is prolonged,
there is always a chance it could complicate Trump's plans to go
to Davos.

    DAVOS, Switzerland Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald
Trump will urge a top-level gathering of political leaders and
chief executives on Friday that his administration will not
tolerate intellectual property theft and trade abuses, a senior
U.S. official said.
    Trump is due to give the main closing address to the World
Economic Forum at the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where outright
and veiled criticism of his America First agenda captured
headlines ahead of the president's arrival on Thursday.
    That agenda has included unilateral trade sanctions and
threats of more action, particularly against China.
    ""The United States will no longer tolerate things like the
theft of intellectual property or forced technology transfers or
industrial subsidies ... and dumping, trade abuses,"" the U.S.
official told reporters in Davos.
    Trump is due to give his speech at 1300 GMT.
    The official said Trump's stance on trade should be viewed
less as a warning than an explanation his commitment to the
international trading system and enforcing ""rules of the road"".
    Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to visit the
annual summit since Bill Clinton in 2000. He was greeted on
arrival on Thursday by hundreds of curious delegates who snapped
pictures as he entered the congress centre.
    He made an immediate impression: he talked up the dollar,
going against the grain of previous remarks made by his treasury
secretary at Davos, and threatened to withhold aid to
Palestinians unless they pursued peace with Israel.
    But a thrust of his visit has been to convince business
leaders to step up investment in the United States.
    ""A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We
are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very
exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank
you very much,"" Trump told reporters in Davos on Thursday.
    After meeting the prime ministers of Britain and Israel,
Trump hosted a dinner with leaders of some of the world's
largest firms, including Nestle, SAP and Siemens, Deloitte and
Bayer. Senior members of his cabinet were also present.
    Trump, a real estate mogul and former reality TV star, had
never been invited to Davos before. He basked in the praise of
several executives, who applauded his tax cuts.
    Two European executives told Reuters they were staying away
from the dinner because they did not want to shake Trump's hand.
One of them consulted with his wife and children before deciding
to dine elsewhere. 
    Those that showed up were treated to a meal of grilled beef
tenderloin with green pea puree or fried Swiss pike perch with
purple carrot puree.
    Trump gave each corporate leader an opportunity to describe
their businesses briefly. Many mentioned the corporate tax cuts
that Trump pushed through the U.S. Congress late last year as a
positive sign of growth and investment, according to a Reuters
reporter who was present.
    His speech on Friday will follow a week of warnings by
European leaders on the dangers of nationalism, isolationism and
protectionism.
    Without naming Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel evoked
the build-up to the two world wars and openly questioned whether
leaders had learned the lessons from those 20th century
conflicts.
    Before his trip to Davos, Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs
on imported solar panels, among the first unilateral trade
restrictions made by the administration as part of a broader
protectionist agenda. [nL2N1PI2EY]
    On Wednesday in Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin made comments supportive of a weaker dollar. Markets
interpreted the remarks as a shift in U.S. policy and sent the
dollar sharply lower, sparking concerns from European allies
about a trade war.
    European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi took a swipe at
Mnuchin's remarks, saying they threatened a decades-old pact
between the world's leading economies not to target
currencies.[nL8N1PK1VF]
    Trump later told CNBC in an interview that he supported a
strong dollar and expected the currency to rise.
    ""The dollar is going to get stronger and stronger and
ultimately I want to see a strong dollar,"" he said, adding that
Mnuchin's comments had been misinterpreted.
    Trump's decision to come to Davos came as a surprise because
he has railed against ""globalists"" and elites, while promoting
an ""America First"" agenda that goes down poorly in this bastion
of free trade, multilateralism and capitalism.
    French President Emmanuel Macron said he had ""strongly
recommended"" that Trump attend the forum during a recent phone
conversation, saying he thought it was a good thing for Trump to
explain his strategic goals and hear different viewpoints.
    There is broad concern in European capitals that 2018 could
be the year Trump's bark on trade turns into bite, as he
considers punitive measures on steel and threatens to end the
90s-era North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and
Mexico.
    Policymakers have been openly critical of his foreign policy
but with the U.S. stock market soaring, corporate tax cuts
padding companies' pockets and U.S. consumers spending again,
some companies here are quietly applauding the U.S. president.
    Trump used a TV appearance from Davos to laud America's
relationship with Britain and sought to smooth over a recent
bilateral spat caused by his retweeting of anti-Muslim videos
originally posted by a leader of a far-right group.
    Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain show, he was pressed
on whether he would apologise for his retweet. He said that if
the group was made up of racists then he would.
    ""Here’s what’s fair, if you’re telling me they’re horrible
people, horrible racist people I would certainly apologise if
you would like me to do that,"" Trump said.

We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of

    WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
is being urged by some top advisers to waive sanctions on Iran
by a Friday deadline, but privately he is expressing reluctance
to do so, a senior administration official said on Wednesday.
    Trump faces deadlines related to the deal starting late this
week, including deciding whether to reimpose oil sanctions
lifted under the 2015 agreement that constrained Iran's nuclear
program.
    Trump will seek to make a final decision on whether to waive
the sanctions during a meeting with national security aides on
Thursday, a senior administration official told Reuters.
    The official told Reuters that Trump's top advisers were
recommending that he extend Iran relief from sanctions.
    If he did so, the official said, the move would likely be
accompanied by new, targeted sanctions on Iranian businesses and
people.
    Another U.S. official said Trump was expected by some
officials to renew the sanctions waivers but stressed that no
final decision had been made.
    Trump has privately gnashed his teeth at having to waive the
sanctions again, believing his predecessor, Democratic President
Barack Obama, negotiated a bad deal for the United States in
agreeing to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
    The official said a decision not to waive the sanctions
would leave the United States in violation of the agreement.
    ""You either waive the sanctions or you don’t and if you
don't you're in breach of the JCPOA,"" the official said.
    Trump and his top advisers have been negotiating with U.S.
lawmakers on Capitol Hill to try to change sanctions legislation
so that he does not face a deadline on whether to waive the
sanctions every 90 days.

    LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said
he had not intended to cause offence in Britain by sharing
anti-Muslim videos originally posted by a leader of a far-right
fringe group and that he would apologise if such people were
horrible racists.
    Trump told ITV's Good Morning Britain show he knew nothing
about the group but that he was the ""least racist person that
anybody's going to meet"" and that his retweet was not an
endorsement.
    Trump sparked outrage in Britain when he shared the
anti-Muslim videos last November and became embroiled in a
public spat with British PM Theresa May who criticised him for
the retweet. [nL8N1O01BQ] 
    When pressed on whether he would apologise for his retweet,
Trump said that if the group was made up of racists then he
would.
    ""Here's what's fair, if you're telling me they're horrible
people, horrible racist people I would certainly apologise if
you would like me to do that,"" Trump said.
    ""I know nothing about them. I don’t want to be involved with
[these] people, but you're telling me about these people because
I know nothing about these people.""
    Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of anti-immigration Britain
First, posted the videos which she said showed a group of people
who were Muslims beating a teenage boy to death, battering a boy
on crutches and destroying a Christian statue. 
    But relations between the two nations, described as ""the
special relationship"", have faced several ups and downs not just
due to Trump's criticism of May, but also his spats with London
Mayor Sadiq Khan and his comments on militant attacks in
Britain. 
    Earlier this month, he cancelled a trip to London to open a
new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed
by the Obama administration to sell the old one for ""peanuts"".
[nL8N1P70ZL] 
    Some Britons are angry at the prospect of a visit by Trump
with large protests expected when he does arrive, most probably
in the second half of the year according to a senior British
government source. [nL9N1NN00Y]
    Officials are discussing whether Trump will be given a state
visit, which means he will be hosted by Queen Elizabeth, and
when exactly it will take place, the source said. [nL9N1NN00Y]
    In the interview aired on Friday, Trump said he loved
Britain very much and got along well with May. 
    ""I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your
Prime Minister,"" Trump said. ""She's been doing a very good job.
We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of
people think we don’t.""
    ""I support her, I support a lot of what she does and a lot
of what she says and I support you militarily very much. We will
come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully
will never happen. I am a tremendous supporter of the UK.""

Mexico foreign ministry and Trump comments)
    By Julia Love
    MEXICO CITY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Mexico on Thursday dismissed
a claim by U.S. President Donald Trump that it was the most
dangerous country in the world and reiterated it would not fund
the construction of a wall along the U.S. southern border.
    In a series of Twitter posts touching on NAFTA trade
negotiations and security, Trump described Mexico as ""the number
one most dangerous country in the world,"" an assertion that was
quickly rebuffed by Mexico's foreign ministry. 
    ""Even though Mexico has a significant problem with violence,
it is plainly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in
the world,"" the ministry said in a statement.
    In the year through November, a total of 23,101 murder
investigations were opened in Mexico, giving the highest annual
figure since records began in 1997. [nL1N1OO00Q]
    That was a murder rate of 18.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, well
below levels in Latin American countries such as Brazil,
Colombia, Venezuela, Honduras and El Salvador, according to U.N.
figures used in the World Bank's online database for 2015, the
last year for which results are available.
    Looking ahead to talks later this month to rework the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the ministry said the
country would put its national interest first, while seeking an
outcome to benefit all countries in the pact.
    Trump has suggested that Mexico could finance construction
of the wall indirectly through changes to NAFTA.[nL8N1PD34P]
    ""If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!"" Trump wrote on
Thursday, without specifying which deal he was referring to.
    Earlier in the day Trump tweeted:
    ""The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or
through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a
ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The
$20 billion dollar Wall is ""peanuts"" compared to what Mexico
makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!""
    Mexico's foreign ministry batted away the Twitter salvos. 
    ""Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA, nor any other aspect of
the bilateral relationship, through social networks or the
media,"" it said in its statement.

    By Andrey Ostroukh
    MOSCOW, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday it would
retaliate against new sanctions imposed by the United States
after President Donald Trump set an ultimatum to fix ""disastrous
flaws"" in a deal curbing Tehran's nuclear programme.
    Trump said on Friday he would waive nuclear sanctions on 
Iran for the last time to give the United States and European
allies a final chance to amend the pact. Washington also imposed
sanctions on the head of Iran's judiciary and
others.[nL1N1P71ZM]
    Russia - one of the parties to the Iran pact alongside the
United States, China, France, Britain, Germany and the European
Union -  called Trump's comments ""extremely negative.""
    The ultimatum puts pressure on Europeans, key backers of the
2015 nuclear deal, to satisfy Trump, who wants the pact
strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.
    While approving the waiver on U.S. sanctions related to the
nuclear deal, Washington announced other sanctions against 14
Iranian entities and people, including judiciary head Ayatollah
Sadeq Larijani, a close ally of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei.
    Describing sanctions against Larijani as ""hostile action"",
Iran's Foreign Ministry said the move ""crossed all red lines of
conduct in the international community and is a violation of
international law and will surely be answered by a serious
reaction of the Islamic Republic,"" state media reported.
    It did not specify what any retaliation might involve.
    Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had earlier
said on Twitter that the deal was ""not renegotiable"" and that
Trump's move ""amounts to desperate attempts to undermine a solid
multilateral agreement.""
    Iran says its nuclear programme has only peaceful aims and
says it will stick to the accord as long as others respect it.
But it has said it would ""shred"" the deal if Washington quit.
    
    ""LAST CHANCE""
    Trump, who has sharply criticised the deal reached in Barack
Obama's presidency, had chafed at having to once again waive
sanctions on a country he sees as a threat in the Middle East.
    ""Despite my strong inclination, I have not yet withdrawn the
United States from the Iran nuclear deal,"" Trump said in a
statement, saying the options were to fix ""the deal’s disastrous
flaws, or the United States will withdraw.""
    ""This is a last chance,"" Trump said, pushing for a separate
agreement and saying the United States would not waive sanctions
again to keep Iran in the pact without such an agreement.
    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called
Trump's remarks ""extremely negative"", RIA state news agency
reported. ""Our worst fears are being confirmed,” he said.
[nL8N1P805E]
    The EU said in a statement it had taken note of Trump’s
decision and would assess its implications. ""It's going to be
complicated to save the deal after this,"" said one European
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    Britain, France and Germany had called on Trump on Thursday
to uphold the pact. [nL8N1P61V9] 
    Senior U.S. administration officials told reporters Trump
would work with Europeans on a follow-on deal to enshrine
triggers that the Iranian government could not exceed related to
ballistic missiles.
    Republican Senator Bob Corker said ""significant progress""
had been made on bipartisan congressional legislation to address
""flaws in the agreement without violating U.S. commitments.""
    
    CONDITIONS
    Trump laid out conditions to keep Washington in the deal.
Iran must allow ""immediate inspections at all sites requested by
international inspectors,"" he said, and ""sunset"" provisions
imposing limits on Iran's nuclear programme must not expire.
    Trump said U.S. law must tie long-range missile and nuclear
weapons programs together, making any missile testing by Iran
subject to ""severe sanctions.""
    The president wants U.S. Congress to modify a law that
reviews U.S. participation in the nuclear deal to include
""trigger points"" that, if violated, would lead to the United
States reimposing its sanctions, the official said.
    This would not entail negotiations with Iran but would be
the result of talks with European allies, the official said.
    A decision to withhold a waiver would have effectively ended
the deal between Iran and the other international signatories.
The other parties to the agreement would have been unlikely to
join the United States in reimposing sanctions.
    Two EU diplomats said EU foreign ministers would discuss
next steps at their next regular meeting on Jan. 22 in Brussels.

    LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Donald Trump and British Prime
Minister Theresa May discussed finalising the details of the
first visit by the U.S. president to Britain later this year
after a meeting in Davos on Thursday, May's office said.
    More than a year into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit
London and many British voters have promised that if he comes to
Britain they would protest against a man they see as opposed to
their values on a range of issues. [nL8N1P70ZL]
    Trump's cancellation of a trip to Britain this month had
raised questions in Britain over the relationship between
Washington and its traditionally closest ally in Europe.
    The two leaders met at the World Economic Forum and they
discussed Brexit, Iran, and worries that jobs could lost at
Canadian plane-maker Bombardier's <BBDb.TO> factory in Northern
Ireland due to a trade dispute with Boeing Co <BA.N>.
    ""The PM and president concluded by asking officials to work
together on finalising the details of a visit by the president
to the UK later this year,"" according to statement from May's
office.
    Earlier this month, Trump cancelled a trip to London to open
a new U.S. embassy in another sign of strained relations with
one of the closest U.S. allies.
    May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his
inauguration last January and was filmed emerging from the White
House holding hands, but a series of disagreement have since
occurred.
    British officials have been dismayed by some of Trump’s
pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims entering
the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked May on
Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British
far-right anti-Islam videos.

vowed on Tuesday to protect American intellectual property, but
made no mention of China, which his administration has accused
of trade abuses, in his first State of the Union speech to
Congress.
    Trump had been expected to deliver strong warnings to
countries about unfair trade practices, including stealing
intellectual property and providing state aid to their
industries.
    Instead, his comments on trade during the speech were
restricted to three sentences in which he repeated that ""fair
and reciprocal"" trade were necessary, but did not elaborate.
    ""We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new
ones,"" Trump said, adding: ""We will protect American workers and
American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of
our trade rules.""
    Trump has threatened to walk away from trade agreements like
the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico,
and the U.S-South Korean Free Trade Agreement, unless they
bolster U.S. manufacturing and American jobs.
    Last week, he imposed tariffs on imported washing machines
and solar panels in his first major trade actions since
withdrawing the United States from the Trans Pacific Partnership
trade agreement within weeks of taking office last year.
    Trump is considering broad tariffs or quotas on steel and
aluminum following investigations by the U.S. Department of
Commerce into whether rising steel and aluminum imports
represent a threat to national security.  
    The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group
representing steel and other basic industries, welcomed Trump's
remarks on trade in his speech but called for actions to combat
Chinese imports.
    ""This speech won’t change China's behavior and defend

    MEXICO CITY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's habit of
slapping down Mexico is feeding nationalist sentiment in the
country's presidential election campaign, prompting contenders
to defy him and strengthening the hand of the frontrunner, who
is courting the anti-establishment vote. 
    In the past week, the three top contenders for the July
election have all said Mexico will not pay for the wall the U.S.
president wants to build on the U.S. southern border. None has
made the point more forcefully than Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
a veteran leftist leading the opinion polls.
    A victory for Lopez Obrador, who was runner-up in 2006 and
2012, could usher in a more distant and confrontational
relationship between the two nations as he promises to lessen
Mexico's economic dependence on foreign powers.
    That dependence is strongest with the United States: Mexico
sends about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor
and the United States has traditionally been the source of the
bulk of foreign direct investment. Under Trump, however, Mexican
views of the United States have soured.
    ""Without being disrespectful, we're going to put him in his
place,"" Lopez Obrador said of Trump on Thursday in the Gulf of
Mexico port of Veracruz, the scene of a notorious national
humiliation when U.S. forces occupied it in 1914.
    Earlier that day, Trump told his Twitter followers that
Mexico was ""rated the number one most dangerous country in the
world."" Although violence is rising in Mexico, its murder rate
remains well below that of several Latin American countries,
data compiled by the United Nations and the World Bank show.
    Lopez Obrador, who said earlier this month he would put an
end to what he called puppet governments in Mexico taking
instructions ""from abroad,"" promised to hit back against Trump's
barbs and tell the American ""what I think"" on Twitter.
    A December survey by polling firm Parametria gave Lopez
Obrador an 11 percentage point lead, while another last week by
Mitofsky gave him a three point advantage, but growing.
    Since taking office a year ago, Trump has often expressed
negative views of Mexico, blaming it for drugs entering the
United States, criticizing U.S. companies with operations south
of the border, and insisting Mexico will pay for the wall he
wants to stop illegal immigration. He has threatened to tie
payment to the terms under which the two neighbors trade by
reworking or canceling the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA).
    Each time, President Enrique Pena Nieto's government has
pushed back.
    This week presidential hopeful Ricardo Anaya of the
conservative National Action Party (PAN), who heads a left-right
coalition, and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's
(PRI) contender, Jose Antonio Meade, also weighed in.
    ""Mexico will NOT under any circumstances pay for that wall,""
Meade said on Twitter on the day Lopez Obrador was in Veracruz.
    Few issues unite Mexicans more than dislike of Trump, who
kicked off his presidential bid in 2015 by accusing the country
of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border.
    Jorge Buendia of pollster Buendia & Laredo said Trump had
made it advantageous for Mexican politicians to criticize him,
and that it would be ""very costly"" for the next president to
extend the hand of friendship towards his government.
    ""So it's only a matter of time before there are much more
critical proposals about Trump and U.S. relations,"" he said.
    The most obvious beneficiary of opposition to Trump, at
least initially, would be Lopez Obrador, Buendia said.
    
    'ANGER AMONG MEXICANS'
    A study published last week featuring data from the Pew
Research Center and Buendia & Laredo showed that since Trump
entered presidential politics, the image of the United States
has deteriorated sharply in Mexico.
    In 2015, 66 percent of Mexicans held a favorable view of the
United States and 29 percent an unfavorable opinion, it showed.
By October 2017, 65 percent of Mexicans had an unfavorable view
of the United States and only 30 percent a positive one.
    Heriberto Galindo, a former PRI congressman and ex-consul
general of Mexico in Chicago, said Trump would end up unifying
the rhetoric of all the presidential candidates against him.
    ""I'm not saying we're heading for war with the United
States, because Mexico is pacifist,"" he said. ""But President
Donald Trump is causing a lot of anger among Mexicans ... and a
negative attitude towards the United States, which is not
helpful, beneficial or healthy, least of all with a neighboring
country.""
    Anti-Trump feeling is only likely to intensify if the
president follows through on threats to dump NAFTA, which
underpins much of Mexico's trade, if it is not reworked to
better favor U.S. interests. Negotiators hold another round of
talks this week to try to overhaul the deal. [nL2N1PH00U]
    Agustin Barrios Gomez, a former federal congressman and head
of Fundacion Imagen Mexico, a group dedicated to promoting
Mexico's image abroad, argued Lopez Obrador does not even need
to sharpen his rhetoric to benefit from Trump, because he has no
credible rivals to oppose his nationalist arguments.
    Both Meade and Anaya represent parties that defended closer
economic integration and cooperation with the United States and
are the only ones to have held power, Barrios Gomez noted.
    Now Trump's hostility has shattered that model, he added.
    ""The feeling's there: you trusted these guys (the United
States), and they turned on you like the left have been saying
for God knows how long,"" he said. ""And that plays to Andres
Manuel's strengths because he doesn't have to say anything.""

    LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Britain's visit invitation to U.S.
President Donald Trump should not be rescinded, British foreign
minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday, stressing that the
United States is an important ally.
    ""I don't believe that is sensible,"" Johnson said when asked
by an opposition lawmaker what it would take for the invitation
for a state visit, accepted by Trump last year, to be withdrawn.
    ""The United States is our closest, most important security,
and indeed economic, partner and will continue to be so."" 
    A separate lawmaker asked Johnson about a claim by U.S.
author Michael Wolff, made in a Sunday newspaper interview, that
Trump saw Queen Elizabeth ""in reality show terms"" and would try
to ""Trumpalise"" her. Wolff did not explain what that word meant.
    Johnson replied: ""I think Her Majesty the Queen is well
capable of taking this American president, or indeed any
American president, in her stride, as she has done over six
remarkable decades. She has seen them come, and she has seen
them go."" 
    During the Queen's 65-year reign there have been 13 U.S.
Presidents, starting with Harry S. Truman. No date has been set
for a Trump visit.

    By Lesley Wroughton
    WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
vowed on Tuesday to protect American intellectual property, but
made little mention of China, which his administration has
accused of trade abuses, in his first State of the Union speech
to Congress.
    Trump had been expected to deliver strong warnings to
countries about unfair trade practices, including stealing
intellectual property and providing state aid to their
industries.
    Instead, his comments on trade during the speech were
restricted to several sentences that omitted China in which he
repeated that ""fair and reciprocal"" trade was necessary.
    ""We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new
ones,"" Trump said, adding: ""We will protect American workers and
American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of
our trade rules.""
    Trump has threatened to walk away from trade agreements like
the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico,
and the U.S-South Korean Free Trade Agreement, unless they
bolster U.S. manufacturing and American jobs.
    Last week, he imposed tariffs on imported washing machines
and solar panels in his first major trade actions since
withdrawing the United States from the Trans Pacific Partnership
trade agreement within weeks of taking office last year.
    Trump is considering broad tariffs or quotas on steel and
aluminum following investigations by the U.S. Department of
Commerce into whether rising steel and aluminum imports
represent a threat to national security.
    In his speech, Trump briefly referred to China as among
""rivals"" that challenge U.S. interests, values and the economy,
prompting China's Foreign Ministry to say that the United States
should ""abandon its Cold War mentality and outdated zero-sum
game ideas.""
    ""China and the United States have broad and important joint
interests,"" ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news
briefing in Beijing on Wednesday when asked about Trump's
remarks, adding that those interests were bigger than the two
countries' differences.
    The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group
representing steel and other basic industries, welcomed Trump's
remarks on trade in his speech but called for actions to combat
Chinese imports.
    ""This speech won’t change China's behavior and defend
American jobs. Only action will,"" said AAM President Scott Paul,
""It's time for the president's policies and actions to match his
talk.""

details)
    By David Alire Garcia, Adriana Barrera and Anthony Esposito
    MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Mexico will leave the NAFTA
negotiating table if U.S. President Donald Trump decides to
trigger a 6-month process to withdraw from the trade pact, three
Mexican sources with knowledge of the talks told Reuters on
Wednesday.
    Reuters reported earlier in the day that Canada was
increasingly convinced that Trump would soon announce the United
States intends to pull out of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), sending the Canadian and Mexican currencies
lower and hurting stocks across the continent.[nL1N1P526O]
    ""I think it's indisputable that if Trump announces a U.S.
withdrawal from NAFTA, well at that moment the negotiations
stop,"" said Raul Urteaga, head of international trade for
Mexico's agriculture ministry.
    The two other sources, who are involved in the trade talks
and asked not to be named, said that Mexico remains firm on its
position to get up and leave from the negotiating table if Trump
goes through with the move.
    While a NAFTA termination letter would start the six-month
exit clock ticking, the United States would not be legally bound
to quit NAFTA once it expires. Washington could use the move as
the ultimate sleight of hand as it seeks to gain leverage over
Canada and Mexico in talks to update the 24-year-old trade
pact.[nL1N1P523E]
    Trump has long called the 1994 treaty a bad deal that hurts
American workers. His negotiating team has set proposals that
have alarmed their Canadian and Mexican counterparts.
    Among the most divisive are plans to establish rules of
origin for NAFTA goods that would set minimum levels of U.S.
content for autos, a sunset clause that would terminate the
trade deal if it is not renegotiated every five years, and
ending the so-called Chapter 19 dispute mechanism.
    Though observers in Canada and Mexico have become
increasingly gloomy about the upcoming Jan. 23-28 Montreal round
in recent weeks, some took heart from a recent speech made by
Trump to farmers this week in which he held back from
provocative comments about the trade deal.
    Urteaga, who was a member of Mexico's original NAFTA
negotiating team in the 1990s, said that Trump's speech was an
""interesting signal."" 
    ""No news, means good news sometimes.""

European allies to agree new sanctions against Iran in an
attempt to prevent U.S. President Donald Trump from terminating

    The report cited diplomats in Brussels as saying that
Germany was pushing for new sanctions together with Britain and

    A German foreign ministry spokeswoman and another government

    Germany wants to punish Iran for its missile programme and
its meddling in conflicts in other Middle East countries, such

    Iran said last week it would retaliate against new sanctions
imposed by Washington after Trump set an ultimatum to fix
""disastrous flaws"" in a deal curbing Tehran's nuclear programme.
    Trump has said he would waive nuclear sanctions on Iran for
the last time to give the United States and European allies a
final chance to amend the pact. Washington also imposed
sanctions on the head of Iran's judiciary and others.

    LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
cancelled a trip to London scheduled for next month to open a
new embassy, blaming Barack Obama for selling off the old one
for ""peanuts"" in a bad deal.
    More than a year into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit
London, with many British voters promising mass protests against
a U.S. leader they see as crude, volatile and opposed to their
values on a range of issues.
    ""(The) reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not
a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the
best located and finest embassy in London for ""peanuts,"" only to
build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars,""
Trump said in a tweet late on Thursday. http://bit.ly/2D48GB2
    ""Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" Trump said.
    The decision to acquire a new London embassy site on the
south bank of the Thames was announced in 2008 under George W.
Bush along with the plans to put the Grosvenor Square site in
Mayfair up for sale.
    A pillar of Britain's foreign policy since World War Two,
the so-called ""special relationship"" with Washington has taken
on added importance as Britain prepares to leave the European
Union in 2019 and seeks new major trade deals. 
    But senior British officials have been dismayed by some of
Trump's pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims
entering the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked
Prime Minister Theresa May on Twitter after she criticised him
for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.
    A Downing Street spokesman declined immediate comment.
    May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his
inauguration in January last year, and they were filmed emerging
from the White House holding hands. She later said Trump took
her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp.
    During that trip a year ago, May extended an invitation to
make a state visit - which includes pomp, pageantry and a formal
banquet with Queen Elizabeth - by the end of 2017. 
    That state visit, which is different to his now cancelled
working trip, has still not yet taken place, though British
officials insist it has not been cancelled.
    The American flag was this month removed from the U.S.
embassy in Grosvenor Square - an area known as ""Little America""
during World War Two, when the square also housed the military
headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. [nL8N1OD3ZQ]
    The new embassy on the south bank is a veritable fortress
set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding
buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks -
and incorporating living quarters for U.S. Marines permanently
stationed inside.
    The $1 billion construction, overlooking the River Thames,
was funded by the sale of other properties in London.

But senior British officials have been dismayed by some of Trump's pronouncements, particularly a proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States and most recently when Trump rebuked Prime Minister Theresa May on Twitter after she criticised him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos. A Downing Street spokesman declined immediate comment. May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration in January last year, and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands. She later said Trump took her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp. During that trip a year ago, May extended an invitation to make a state visit - which includes pomp, pageantry and a formal banquet with Queen Elizabeth - by the end of 2017. That state visit, which is different to his now cancelled working trip, has still not yet taken place, though British officials insist it has not been cancelled. The American flag was this month removed from the U.S. embassy in Grosvenor Square - an area known as ""Little America"" during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The new embassy on the south bank is a veritable fortress set back at least 100 feet from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside. The $1 billion construction, overlooking the River Thames, was funded by the sale of other properties in London.",cancel trip london schedule next month open new embassy blame barack obama sell old one peanuts bad deal year presidency yet visit london many british voters promise mass protest leader see crude volatile oppose value range issue reason cancel trip london big fan obama administration sell perhaps best locate finest embassy london peanuts build new one location 12 billion dollars tweet late thursday httpbitly2d48gb2 bad deal want cut ribbonno decision acquire new london embassy site south bank thames announce 2008 george w bush along plan put grosvenor square site mayfair sale pillar britains foreign policy since world war two socalled special relationship washington take add importance britain prepare leave european union 2019 seek new major trade deal senior british officials dismay pronouncements particularly propose ban muslims enter unite state recently rebuke prime minister theresa may twitter criticise retweeting british farright antiislam videos street spokesman decline immediate comment may first foreign leader visit inauguration january last year film emerge white house hold hand later take hand gentlemanly gesture walk ramp trip year ago may extend invitation make state visit include pomp pageantry formal banquet queen elizabeth end 2017 state visit different cancel work trip still yet take place though british officials insist cancel american flag month remove embassy grosvenor square area know little america world war two square also house military headquarter general dwight eisenhower new embassy south bank veritable fortress set back least 100 feet surround build mostly newlyerected highrise residential block incorporate live quarter marines permanently station inside 1 billion construction overlook river thames fund sale properties london

    By Noah Barkin 
    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European leaders will
be out in force at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week
to defend multilateralism before U.S. President Donald Trump
arrives to deliver his ""America First"" message.
    Politicians, business chiefs, bankers and celebrities will
meet in the Swiss Alps under the banner ""Creating a Shared
Future in a Fractured World"" for the four-day gathering against
an unsettling global backdrop.
    A decade after the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman
Brothers helped trigger a global financial crisis, economic
growth has returned and stock markets are hitting record highs.
    Yet there is a nagging fear among many in Davos that the
brighter economic outlook could turn out to be little more than
a mirage if the daunting array of geopolitical threats - from
protectionism and climate change to cyber attacks and outright
war - gather pace in 2018.
    ""Not all geopolitical threats are threats to financial
markets,"" Axel Weber, the chairman of Swiss bank UBS and former
president of the German Bundesbank told Reuters. ""But I agree
that there may be a disconnect, which has been going on for some
time already and may well continue for some time.""
    The Global Risks Report published by the WEF last week
showed that many see a heightened risk of political and economic
confrontations between major powers this year. [nL8N1PB5KX]
    Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to attend the forum
since Bill Clinton in 2000, is a source of much of this anxiety
after a volatile first year in office in which he has turned
American foreign policy on its head. 
    The forum will open on Tuesday with a speech by India's
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and end on Friday, when Trump is
due to address the massive auditorium where Chinese President Xi
Jinping spoke last year, offering to fill the global leadership
void created by an inward-looking Washington.
    White House officials said over the weekend that a
government shutdown in the United States was unlikely to prevent
Trump from making the trip, although the budget director Mick
Mulvaney said it was now ""in flux"". [nS0N1LS008][nW1N18Y00A]
    In the days between Modi and Trump, the leaders of Europe's
biggest countries, absent from Davos last year and emboldened by
their own economic recovery, will offer an alternative vision to
Trump and Xi, who the Europeans say has failed to deliver on his
promise of a year ago to open China up to foreign investment.
    
    EUROPE'S NEW STAR 
    The charge will be led by French President Emmanuel Macron,
the new star of European politics, who in an audacious move, has
invited many of the business leaders who will be in Davos to the
Palace of Versailles on Monday to press them to invest in
France. [nL8N1PE3GB]
    When he speaks in Davos on Wednesday, the former investment
banker will offer his own ""diagnosis"" of globalisation and set
out a vision for addressing widening inequalities, global
warming and the rise of nationalism, his advisers say.
    ""I don't think Macron will be able to resist being the
counter-Trump,"" said Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham
House think tank in London.
    Macron will be joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
returning to the world stage after months of political limbo at
home, and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.
    European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, back in
Davos after a 20-year absence, is also due to speak.
    The WEF is a marathon of panel discussions, lunches and
cocktail parties that delve into subjects as diverse as
terrorism, artificial intelligence and wellness.
    This year's conference will include several sessions on
sexual harassment, a nod to the #MeToo movement that erupted
after allegations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer
Harvey Weinstein. 
    Criticised in past years for not representing women, the WEF
appointed seven female co-chairs this year, including Christine
Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
Ginni Rometty, the CEO of IBM.
    Among the other leaders attending are British Prime Minister
Theresa May, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and several African
leaders, including Zimbabwe's new president Emmerson Mnangagwa.
    Last year, the sole envoy from the Trump camp in the week
leading up to his inauguration was Anthony Scaramucci, the New
York financier who was sacked after just 10 days as White House
communications director.
    This year, Trump will be joined by a large U.S. delegation
including Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.
    For the first time in years, Iran will not be represented. 
WEF officials could not say whether the late cancellation by
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif had anything to do with
Trump's decision to speak.

Wednesday warned President Donald Trump of the potential
financial and political consequences of scrapping the North
American Free Trade Agreement and urged U.S., Mexican, and
Canadian officials to find ways to modernize the accord.
    Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement, which
is heavily utilized by U.S. and Canadian railroads hauling
freight such as cars, beer, and grain across the three
countries.

scrapping NAFTA would put supply chains, jobs and consumers at
risk and could come back to haunt Trump politically.
    Cross-border rail trade between the United States and Mexico
is dominated by Kansas City Southern. More than a quarter of its
revenue comes from U.S.-Mexico shipments, and grain from
American farms forms an important portion of cross-border
carloads.
    Ottensmeyer said many farmers who supported Trump in the
2016 election support NAFTA and are becoming critical of Trump's
threats to scrap the accord. 
    ""You won't talk to a single farmer who is against NAFTA,""
Ottensmeyer said. ""They did not vote for Donald Trump because of
NAFTA, they decided to set that aside. I think (Trump) is
beginning to understand that, the more time he spends in rural
America.""
    ""Be careful what you do here,"" he said.
    Washington has taken a hard line in talks,
saying that concessions are the only way for Canada and Mexico
to keep the deal. Talks appear to be stalled heading into the
penultimate round of negotiations scheduled to begin next week

Trump signed executive order, adds reaction)
    By Jeff Mason
    NASHVILLE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on
Monday told farmers gathered in Tennessee that he supports crop
insurance, signaling a possible shift from his proposals last
year to shrink a program that many farmers rely on for funding
their operations.
    Speaking at the American Farm Bureau's annual convention,
Trump said Congress would include the subsidies for crop
insurance premiums in the upcoming ""farm bill"" that directs
billions of dollars each year to agriculture, nutrition, food
and land-conservation programs. 
    “I‘m looking forward to working with Congress to pass the
farm bill on time so that it delivers for all of you and I
support a bill that includes crop insurance,"" Trump said after
noting Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts was in
attendance. “We’re working hard on the farm bill and I think
it’s going to go well.” 
    In May Trump angered farm groups, which represent the rural
voters who generally support his Republican Party, when he
proposed cutting $46.54 billion in federal agricultural funding,
mostly by capping the amount the government chips in toward crop
insurance. There currently is no limit to the support the
government gives farmers for insurance premiums. [nL1N1IP1SL]
     Trump, who swept Tennessee in the 2016 election, also
signed an executive order after the speech to make it easier for
the private sector to locate broadband infrastructure on federal
land and buildings, part of a push to expand high-speed internet
in rural America. Faster internet speeds in rural areas are
often considered key to addressing the economic divide between
rural and urban America, but the costs have so far been
prohibitive.
    About 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high-
speed internet service, the Federal Communications Commission
said in a 2016 report.
    ""We need to get rural America more connected. We need it for
our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our
home-based businesses,"" a White House official told reporters
ahead of Trump's speech.
    The White House described the moves as an incremental step
to help spur private development while the administration
figures out how it can help with funding, something that could
become part of Trump's plan to invest in infrastructure.
    The CEO of the leading telecommunications trade group in the
country, Jonathan Spalter, said USTelecom would push to ensure
the government sets aside money for helping build and upgrade
network infrastructure, as well as dismantling and streamlining
regulations.

Speaking at the American Farm Bureau's annual convention, Trump said Congress would include the subsidies for crop insurance premiums in the upcoming ""farm bill"" that directs billions of dollars each year to agriculture, nutrition, food and land-conservation programs. “I‘m looking forward to working with Congress to pass the farm bill on time so that it delivers for all of you and I support a bill that includes crop insurance,"" Trump said after noting Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts was in attendance. “We’re working hard on the farm bill and I think it’s going to go well.” In May Trump angered farm groups, which represent the rural voters who generally support his Republican Party, when he proposed cutting $46.54 billion in federal agricultural funding, mostly by capping the amount the government chips in toward crop insurance. There currently is no limit to the support the government gives farmers for insurance premiums. Trump, who swept Tennessee in the 2016 election, also signed an executive order after the speech to make it easier for the private sector to locate broadband infrastructure on federal land and buildings, part of a push to expand high-speed internet in rural America. Faster internet speeds in rural areas are often considered key to addressing the economic divide between rural and urban America, but the costs have so far been prohibitive. About 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high- speed internet service, the Federal Communications Commission said in a 2016 report. ""We need to get rural America more connected. We need it for our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our home-based businesses,"" a White House official told reporters ahead of Trump's speech. The White House described the moves as an incremental step to help spur private development while the administration figures out how it can help with funding, something that could become part of Trump's plan to invest in infrastructure. The CEO of the leading telecommunications trade group in the country, Jonathan Spalter, said USTelecom would push to ensure the government sets aside money for helping build and upgrade network infrastructure, as well as dismantling and streamlining regulations.",monday tell farmers gather tennessee support crop insurance signal possible shift proposals last year shrink program many farmers rely fund operations speak american farm bureaus annual convention congress include subsidies crop insurance premiums upcoming farm bill direct billions dollars year agriculture nutrition food landconservation program im look forward work congress pass farm bill time deliver support bill include crop insurance note senate agriculture committee chairman pat roberts attendance work hard farm bill think go go well may anger farm group represent rural voters generally support republican party propose cut 4654 billion federal agricultural fund mostly cap amount government chip toward crop insurance currently limit support government give farmers insurance premiums sweep tennessee 2016 election also sign executive order speech make easier private sector locate broadband infrastructure federal land build part push expand highspeed internet rural america faster internet speed rural areas often consider key address economic divide rural urban america cost far prohibitive 39 percent rural americans lack access high speed internet service federal communications commission 2016 report need get rural america connect need tractors need school need homebased businesses white house official tell reporters ahead speech white house describe move incremental step help spur private development administration figure help fund something could become part plan invest infrastructure ceo lead telecommunications trade group country jonathan spalter ustelecom push ensure government set aside money help build upgrade network infrastructure well dismantle streamline regulations

background, details)
    By David Ljunggren
    OTTAWA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau said in an interview he does not think U.S. President
Donald Trump will pull out of NAFTA, despite differences over
how to update the trade pact, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp
said on Wednesday.
    Trudeau's comments were among the most positive made by any
Canadian official since talks started last year to revamp a $1.2
trillion treaty that Trump calls a disaster.
    ""It obviously would be bad if we canceled it, so I don't
think the president is going to be cancelling it,"" Trudeau told
the CBC in an interview recorded on Tuesday. The CBC released
excerpts on Wednesday.
    Trudeau also told the CBC that Canada has multiple
contingency plans in the event Washington does announce it plans
to withdraw. The Trump administration is demanding big changes
to the pact, and this has caused tensions with Canada and
Mexico.
    Trump's trade chief, speaking in Montreal on Monday after
the sixth of eight rounds of talks, rejected proposals for
unblocking the negotiations but promised to seek quick
breakthroughs. [nL2N1PO1ES]
    Foreign ministers from the United States, Canada and Mexico
will meet in Mexico City on Friday to discuss the talks and
other issues, the Canadian government said on Wednesday.
    The talks on renegotiating the 1994 three-party North
American Free Trade Agreement began soon after Trump took office
a year ago, saying that if it could not be overhauled to better
favor U.S. interests and American workers, Washington would pull
out of the pact.
    In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump said
""America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair
trade deals,"" but did not mention NAFTA by name.
    As recently as Jan. 10, Canadian government sources told
Reuters that Ottawa was increasingly convinced the United States
would give notice of withdrawal. The news hit stock markets and
the Canadian and Mexican currencies. [nL1N1P526O]
    Asked about contingency plans, Trudeau said ""not only do we
have a Plan B, we have a Plan C and D and E and F"". He declined
to give details.
    ""I think one of the dangers is falling into hypotheticals
and chasing rabbits down holes,"" he told the CBC.
    ""Just know that we have looked at a broad range of scenarios
and have an approach that is going to continue to stand up for
Canadian jobs while we diversify our markets.""
    Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has
repeatedly said his ""Plan B"" is to find more overseas markets.
Canada currently sends around 75 percent of all goods exports to
the United States.

complained in a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday
over the lack of transparency in trade negotiations by his
administration and called on him to direct agency heads to
release documents on trade investigations.
    The letter comes a day after the Commerce Department
submitted a report to Trump on whether foreign steel imports
threaten U.S. national security. [nL1N1P7038]
    Among the letter's signers is Ron Wyden of Oregon, the most
senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees
trade policy. Others include Ben Cardin of Maryland, Debbie
Stabenow of Michigan, Mark Warner of Virginia, Bob Menendez of
New Jersey, and Maria Cantwell of Washington. 
    In particular, the letter complains about the lack of
transparency ahead of the first round of talks last week on
modifying a five-year-old free trade agreement with South Korea.
Both Republican and Democrats have expressed concern over the
decision by Trump to amend the pact, known as KORUS, at a time
when tensions with North Korea over its nuclear and missiles
programs have escalated.[nL1N1P01T8]
    Since taking office in 2017, Trump has pulled the United
States out of talks on a 14-nation Asia-Pacific trade pact,
started negotiations on a new deal for the North American Free
Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada and
initiated a review of the 2012 Korea deal.[nL1N1P70QZ]
    ""The failure of the administration to release several
trade-related reports raise serious questions regarding the
administration's commitment to openness with the American public
when it comes to trade policy,"" the senators wrote in the letter
to Trump.
    ""We urge you to act swiftly to direct agencies to publicly
release all completed trade-related reports and to direct USTR,
in its negotiations with Korea to comply with transparency and
consultation requirements set out in law in 2015,"" they said.
    Trump launched the ""Section 232"" steel investigation in
April, opening the way for his administration to impose broad
tariffs or import quotas on imports of foreign steel.
    The investigation was kept under wraps at the Commerce
Department, but the agency faced a Jan. 15 statutory deadline to
present its report to the White House. A similar national
security probe into aluminum imports invoking the same Cold
War-era trade law is due on Jan. 22.
    While forcing a reduction of excess production in China,
which now supplies half the world’s steel, is a key goal of any
potential restrictions, broad tariffs would have a bigger impact
on steelmakers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and Turkey.

will extend sanctions relief granted to Iran under its 2015
nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers,
according to a tweet by a Bloomberg reporter on Thursday.
    Trump, who has vowed to scrap the nuclear pact, faces a
deadline on Friday to decide on the sanctions, and a decision to
withhold a waiver would have effectively ended the deal that put
limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for easing Western
sanctions.
    The U.S. Congress requires the president to decide
periodically whether to certify Iran's compliance with the deal
and issue a waiver to allow U.S sanctions to remain suspended. 
    A U.S. official said on Wednesday that if Trump was to waive

    WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Robert Murray, the chief
executive one of America's largest coal mining companies,
criticized U.S. regulators on Tuesday for rejecting the Trump
administration's proposed subsidies for aging coal and nuclear
power plants - saying the decision could lead to higher
electricity costs for consumers.
    The backlash from one of President Donald Trump's big
supporters reflects frustration in the coal industry as the
White House struggles to deliver on a promise to revive the 
coal sector, which has been in decline for years due to
competition from cheaper natural gas.
    “This is a bureaucratic cop-out,” Murray, CEO of
privately-held Murray Energy [MUYEY.UL], said in a statement. “I
fear that we will now immediately observe the announcement of
further decommissioning of nuclear and coal-fired electricity
generation that will further exacerbate this critical
situation,” he said, warning that power prices could rise as a
result. 
     Energy Secretary Rick Perry had proposed the idea of
allowing coal and nuclear power plants to recoup their operating
costs through regulated pricing in September, saying the perk
was needed to stem a string of plant closures in recent years
and shore up grid resilience.
    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Monday
rejected the proposal saying it was not needed, may not be fair
to competing generators using natural gas, solar energy or wind,
and was beyond the commission's responsibilities. [nL1N1P31J9]
    The decision by the five-person commission - which includes
four Trump administration nominees - was a setback for Trump's
pro-coal agenda, but cheered an unusual alliance of natural gas
drillers, environmentalists, and renewable energy advocates that
either compete with coal or oppose its emissions.
    Murray vigorously lobbied the Trump and the Energy
Department last year to help the coal industry, saying he handed
the administration a three-page list of suggestions to do so.   
    In his statement Tuesday, he said the recent bout of cold
weather across the United States underscored the need to keep
coal and nuclear plants functioning.
    But FERC commissioner Richard Glick said Monday that coal
and nuclear plants had been unreliable. 
    ""Many coal and nuclear plants with significant on-site fuel
supplies have failed to function during extreme weather events
because those fuel supplies froze, flooded or were otherwise
unavailable,"" Glick wrote. 
    Another Trump ally, former campaign manager Corey
Lewandowski, also blasted the FERC decision on Tuesday, saying 
the commissioners had failed to carry out the president's
agenda.

    By Paritosh Bansal
    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Protectionism is
gaining ground and globalisation is losing its appeal, but India
is open for business, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told
the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.   
    Modi is leading a big government and business delegation to
the summit in Davos, the first Indian prime minister do so in 21
years, aiming to showcase India as a fast-growing economic power
and a potential driver of global growth. 
    His comments on rising trade barriers came ahead of an
address to the forum later this week by U.S. President Donald
Trump, who has championed inward looking policies for the
world's biggest economy.
    ""Instead of globalisation, the power of protectionism is
putting its head up. Their wish is not only to save themselves
from globalisation, but to change the natural flow of
globalisation,"" Modi said at the opening of the forum, which has
attracted 70 heads of state and government, chief executives and
top bankers.
    ""The result of this is that we are seeing new types of
tariff and non-tariff-based barriers being imposed. Bilateral
and multilateral trade negotiations appear to have come to a
halt.
    ""There is a slowdown in cross-border financial investments
and the expansion of (the) global supply chain appears to have
slowed down."" 
    Trump has been pushing an ""America First"" policy of getting
businesses to invest in the United States instead of overseas,
potentially affecting the growth prospects of emerging economies
such as India dependent on foreign investment.  
    During his 2016 election campaign, Trump blamed
globalisation for ravaging U.S. manufacturing jobs as companies
sought to reduce labor costs by relocating to Mexico and
elsewhere. Trump is due to address the forum on Friday. 
    Modi said climate change was a major threat to the world,
yet the world had failed to come together to tackle it. He said
everyone wanted carbon emissions to be cut, but the rich world
was not ready to help developing economies with new technology.
    India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies
and a growing contributor to pollution, has said it is keen to
honour its commitment to clean up the environment despite Trump
pulling out of the Paris accord on cutting carbon emissions.

Their wish is not only to save themselves from globalisation, but to change the natural flow of globalisation,"" Modi said at the opening of the forum, which has attracted 70 heads of state and government, chief executives and top bankers. ""The result of this is that we are seeing new types of tariff and non-tariff-based barriers being imposed. Bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations appear to have come to a halt. ""There is a slowdown in cross-border financial investments and the expansion of global supply chain appears to have slowed down."" Trump has been pushing an ""America First"" policy of getting businesses to invest in the United States instead of overseas, potentially affecting the growth prospects of emerging economies such as India dependent on foreign investment. During his 2016 election campaign, Trump blamed globalisation for ravaging U.S. manufacturing jobs as companies sought to reduce labor costs by relocating to Mexico and elsewhere. Trump is due to address the forum on Friday. Modi said climate change was a major threat to the world, yet the world had failed to come together to tackle it. He said everyone wanted carbon emissions to be cut, but the rich world was not ready to help developing economies with new technology. India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies and a growing contributor to pollution, has said it is keen to honour its commitment to clean up the environment despite Trump pulling out of the Paris accord on cutting carbon emissions.",protectionism gain grind globalisation lose appeal india open business indian prime minister narendra modi tell world economic forum tuesday modi lead big government business delegation summit davos first indian prime minister 21 years aim showcase india fastgrowing economic power potential driver global growth comment rise trade barriers come ahead address forum later week champion inward look policies worlds biggest economy instead globalisation power protectionism put head wish save globalisation change natural flow globalisation modi open forum attract 70 head state government chief executives top bankers result see new type tariff nontariffbased barriers impose bilateral multilateral trade negotiations appear come halt slowdown crossborder financial investments expansion global supply chain appear slow push america first policy get businesses invest unite state instead overseas potentially affect growth prospect emerge economies india dependent foreign investment 2016 election campaign blame globalisation ravage manufacture job company seek reduce labor cost relocate mexico elsewhere due address forum friday modi climate change major threat world yet world fail come together tackle everyone want carbon emissions cut rich world ready help develop economies new technology india one worlds fastest grow major economies grow contributor pollution keen honour commitment clean environment despite pull paris accord cut carbon emissions

    By Noah Barkin 
    BERLIN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
is considering joining French President Emmanuel Macron at the
World Economic Forum in Davos next week in what could turn into
an epic clash of competing world views with U.S. President
Donald Trump.
    Merkel, who has been struggling to put together a government
since a German election in September, had been expected to skip
the annual gathering of leaders, CEOs, bankers and celebrities
in the Swiss Alps for a third straight year.
    But after clinching a preliminary coalition agreement with
the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) on Friday, German
officials said Merkel could travel to Davos after all, possibly
setting up a major confrontation with Trump, who is expected to
speak on the final day of the forum.
    An appearance would signal Merkel's return to the world
stage after months of political limbo in which she has avoided
the limelight and been dismissed by some in the German and
international media as a spent force.
    It would also allow her and Macron, who is scheduled to
speak at the forum on Jan. 24, two days before Trump, to
reaffirm their commitment to reforming the European Union after
Britain's decision to leave, and to defend liberal democratic
values in the face of Trump's ""America First"" policies.
    Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert was coy last week when
asked whether she might attend the WEF, which will run from Jan.
23-26 under the banner ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured
World"" and will attract some 60 heads of state and government.
    But after clinching a preliminary deal with the SPD, the
chances that she could attend appear to have risen. German
officials said no final decision had been taken and that Merkel
may wait for the outcome of an SPD congress in Bonn next Sunday
- where the party will formally decide whether to enter
coalition talks with her conservatives - before committing.
    Officials at the WEF said they believed Merkel was still
considering whether to attend. If she does, it is unlikely that
she or Macron would overlap with Trump, who is expected to
arrive on the afternoon of Jan. 25.
    This year's forum will be opened by Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi on Jan. 23. Britain's Theresa May, Canada's Justin
Trudeau and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu are also expected, as
well as celebrities such as actress Cate Blanchett and musician
Elton John.
    Last year's gathering took place in the week leading up to
Trump's inauguration and was headlined by Chinese President Xi
Jinping, who signalled his readiness to fill the vacuum in
global leadership created by America's shift inward.
    
    UNITED IN ANTIPATHY
    Since then, Trump has pulled the United States out of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal with Asian
countries, announced a withdrawal from the Paris climate accord
and threatened to torpedo an agreement between Western powers
and Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear programme.
    He has stirred fears of conflict with North Korea by
engaging in an escalating war of words with its leader Kim Jong
Un. Last week, he stirred international outrage by referring to
Haiti and African nations as ""shithole countries"", according to
members of Congress who attended a meeting in the White House.
    On Saturday, some 500 demonstrators marched in the Swiss
capital Bern to protest against Trump's plans to attend the WEF.
    ""There are very few things in the world that unite countries
as much as their antipathy towards Trump and what he is doing,""
said Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy
Eurasia Group, and a regular at Davos.
    ""In the United States he may have 40 percent who approve of
what he's doing. In the Davos crowd it is closer to 5 percent."" 
    The visit by Trump will be the first by a U.S. president
since Bill Clinton in 2000. He will be accompanied by a large
delegation that is expected to include his son-in-law Jared
Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson.
    Merkel has had a frosty relationship with Trump, who accused
her during his campaign for the presidency of ""ruining Germany""
by allowing hundreds of thousands of refugees, many fleeing war
in the Middle East, into the country in 2015.
    She was hailed in some Western media as the last defender of
liberal democratic values after Trump's victory. Since then, the
election of Macron, a pro-European centrist who, like Merkel,
supports free trade and the global rules-based order, has given
her a powerful ally in the confrontation with Trump.
    Macron is slated to speak for 45 minutes in the evening of
Jan. 24 in Davos, a ski resort in eastern Switzerland.
    ""My instinct tells me that Macron will go big,"" said Robin
Niblett, director of the Chatham House think tank in London. ""He
won't just talk about Europe. He will try to take up the mantle
of the free world under Europe's wing.""
    If he is joined by Merkel, who has made seven appearances at
the WEF since becoming chancellor in 2005, that message may
resonate even louder.

    By Jeff Mason
    WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Following a disruptive start
to 2018, President Donald Trump will huddle with top Republicans
on a two-day retreat starting on Friday to lay out legislative
priorities for the year and discuss a strategy for pivotal
November congressional elections.
    Days after explosive comments by Trump's former chief
strategist, Steve Bannon, left the White House on the defensive,
the president will sit down at Camp David with party leaders,
including House of Representative Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
    Trump achieved the first major legislative win of his
presidency in December with tax legislation long sought by his
party and its supporters. 
    The president is eager for more victories and the White
House has targeted infrastructure policy and an overhaul of
entitlement programs as its top priorities. Immigration
legislation, in particular a plan to help people who were
brought to the United States illegally as children, is also on
the agenda.
    While Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure
first, Ryan is more interested in tackling entitlement programs
such as welfare.
    A White House official said the timing of legislation would
be discussed as well as the political priority of giving
Republicans substantive issues to highlight ahead of November
elections when the party will battle to keep control of
Congress.
    All 435 members in the House and one-third of the 100
members in the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic
takeover of one or both chambers could help stifle Trump's
agenda.
    The meeting at Camp David, the presidential retreat in
Maryland, which will also include Cabinet officials, follows an
uproar over the description in a new book of an inept Trump
White House. In the book, Bannon also suggested the president's
son and son-in-law committed treason by meeting with a Russian
official during the 2016 campaign.
    Trump broke with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former
adviser had ""lost his mind"" after the comments attributed to
Bannon in Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White
House"" were made public. [nL1N1P00HZ]
       
    
    'COMPLETE FANTASY'
    The strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch
topics after the furor over the book, which goes on sale on
Friday. [nL1N1OZ0OG]
    ""The White House doesn't mind the optics after a few days of
the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on
the book. The president sits down and charts the course forward
... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,"" a White
House official said.
    Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that
Wolff's book was a ""complete fantasy"" filled with tabloid
gossip. ""This is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to
sell books,"" she said in an interview with Fox News Channel on
Friday, referring to Wolff.  
    Sanders also called for the conservative online outlet
Breitbart News to consider parting ways with Bannon, who leads
the group and had pledged to campaign for anti-establishment
Republican candidates in the 2018 elections.   
    Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn said the weekend meeting
would help lawmakers and administration officials get on the

Days after explosive comments by Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, left the White House on the defensive, the president will sit down at Camp David with party leaders, including House of Representative Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump achieved the first major legislative win of his presidency in December with tax legislation long sought by his party and its supporters. The president is eager for more victories and the White House has targeted infrastructure policy and an overhaul of entitlement programs as its top priorities. Immigration legislation, in particular a plan to help people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, is also on the agenda. While Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling entitlement programs such as welfare. A White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed as well as the political priority of giving Republicans substantive issues to highlight ahead of November elections when the party will battle to keep control of Congress. All 435 members in the House and one-third of the 100 members in the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could help stifle Trump's agenda. The meeting at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, which will also include Cabinet officials, follows an uproar over the description in a new book of an inept Trump White House. In the book, Bannon also suggested the president's son and son-in-law committed treason by meeting with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign. Trump broke with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had ""lost his mind"" after the comments attributed to Bannon in Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" were made public. 'COMPLETE FANTASY' The strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch topics after the furor over the book, which goes on sale on Friday. ""The White House doesn't mind the optics after a few days of the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on the book. The president sits down and charts the course forward ... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,"" a White House official said. Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that Wolff's book was a ""complete fantasy"" filled with tabloid gossip. ""This is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books,"" she said in an interview with Fox News Channel on Friday, referring to Wolff. Sanders also called for the conservative online outlet Breitbart News to consider parting ways with Bannon, who leads the group and had pledged to campaign for anti-establishment Republican candidates in the 2018 elections. Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn said the weekend meeting would help lawmakers and administration officials get on the same page about their priorities. ""This administration came into office perhaps not really knowing for sure that they would win the election, and was a little bit behind the curve in terms of preparing. Now I think they’ve recognized that that sort of coordination is really important in order to get things done,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

    Through November, last year's pork exports to Mexico totaled
726,717 metric tons, which accounted for nearly a third of the
total U.S. export volume and valued at $1.37 billion, according
to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF).

    WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department
has sent President Donald Trump the results of its national
security probe into aluminum imports, Trump administration
officials said on Sunday, while declining to disclose details.
    White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters confirmed that the
findings in the ""Section 232"" probe were delivered on Friday,
just before many government agencies shut down due to the lack
of a government funding deal in Congress.
    Another administration official said an announcement
regarding the submission was expected on Sunday, but that it
would look similar to the one that accompanied a Jan. 11
submission on a parallel probe into steel imports. [nL1N1P7038]
    That announcement did not divulge whether the Commerce
Department found that steel imports pose a threat to national
security, nor whether it recommended Trump impose broad new
tariffs or quotas on imports to protect domestic producers. 
    Trump has promised he would take action to protect steel and
aluminum workers from imports, especially in the face of Chinese
overcapacity in both metals.
    But the question of whether to order broad tariffs or quotas
on steel and aluminum has been the subject of intense debate in
the White House, pitting officials who favor more aggressive
restrictions against pro-business factions who favor a more
cautious approach to avoid a run-up in prices of the metals or
disruptions to U.S. allies that produce them.
    ""We look forward to swift and decisive action by the
President on this issue in order to save the American aluminum
industry,"" Century Aluminum <CENX.O> said in a statement on
Sunday night. ""American producers need comprehensive relief
against excess capacity from all state supported enterprises --
not just China -- to create a fair playing field."" 
    Critics say using national security to erect steel and
aluminum tariffs could trigger a trade war with China, undermine
the global rules-based trading system and hurt America's friends
more than China, as well as damage global growth prospects.

But the question of whether to order broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum has been the subject of intense debate in the White House, pitting officials who favor more aggressive restrictions against pro-business factions who favor a more cautious approach to avoid a run-up in prices of the metals or disruptions to U.S. allies that produce them. ""We look forward to swift and decisive action by the President on this issue in order to save the American aluminum industry,"" Century Aluminum <CENX.O> said in a statement on Sunday night. ""American producers need comprehensive relief against excess capacity from all state supported enterprises -- not just China -- to create a fair playing field.""

    WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump
has signaled support for anti-government protests in Iran, but
in two weeks he faces a decision on U.S. policy toward the
Islamic Republic that suddenly seems riskier than it did a week
ago.
    The six days of demonstrations in several Iranian cities
began over economic conditions, and Trump must decide by
mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran's
oil exports under the terms of an international nuclear deal.
    If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the
economic pain for Iran's leaders. But analysts said it could
also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran's people
in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a
decade. [nL8N1OX0XY]
    The sanctions waivers were included in the 2015 nuclear pact
with Iran that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for
limits on its nuclear program.
    Trump has repeatedly criticized the deal and promised to
negotiate a better one. Reimposing oil sanctions would
essentially kill the agreement.
    Reviving sanctions on Iran's main export would allow Tehran
to argue that the United States is ultimately the cause of
Iran's economic problems, said Richard Nephew, who worked on
sanctions policy at the White House under President Barack
Obama.
    ""Let's say Trump was inclined not to renew the waivers. I
think that (the protests) make it very hard for him to do that
now because now that plays into the regime's hands in a way that
I don't frankly think the administration is going to want to
do,"" said Nephew, now at Columbia University's Center on Global
Energy Policy.
    White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday that
Trump has not made a final decision on whether to waive
sanctions. Asked whether the protests had changed Trump's
calculation, she replied: ""Not necessarily.""
    
    BLAME THE OUTSIDERS
    Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Council
on Foreign Relations, said Iran's leaders will blame internal
troubles on the United States and other outside powers, no
matter what Washington does.
    ""The regime's argument that the world is against us is a
constant for 38 years,"" Takeyh said in a telephone interview.
""The optics of waiving sanctions in the midst of all this - it
just doesn't look good.""
    Takeyh and three U.S. officials who follow Iran said the
protests undercut Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a relative
moderate who took office in 2013 pledging to improve Iran's
economy, more than they threaten the country's clerical rulers.
    Former CIA Director John Brennan, in a Twitter post, said
the Trump administration with its condemnation of Iran and the
nuclear deal over the last year has squandered an opportunity to
bolster reformists in Iran and promote peaceful political 
change.
    ""Bluster is neither a strategy nor a mechanism for exercise
of U.S. power and influence,"" Brennan wrote.
    Yet in recent days, Trump and his top aides have charted a
more careful course in reacting to the demonstrations, which
have led to at least 21 deaths and hundreds of arrests.
    Trump in a Tweet on Tuesday called the Tehran government a
""brutal and corrupt regime."" But he and other U.S. officials
have shied away from suggesting Washington seeks the overthrow
of Iran's Islamic theocracy, calling instead for Iranian
authorities to respect protesters' rights.
    State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Tuesday urged
Iranian security forces to exercise restraint in dealing with
protests and called on Tehran to restore access to social media
sites that have been restricted. [nS0N1MS02O]
    Nauert suggested the U.S. government could impose sanctions
against Iranian officials who repress peaceful protests.
    Another U.S. official said a coherent policy response to
events in Iran cannot be formulated until Washington has a
better understanding of the composition of the protesters, the
breadth of the economic and political grievances that are
driving them, and what threat they pose to the government.
    The United States has had no diplomatic presence in Iran
since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, limiting its ability to
interpret events.
    The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Washington's main effort now was ""trying to get a sense of who
is mostly behind this, how large it is and does it have legs.""

    WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The United States mistakenly
supported China's membership of the World Trade Organization in
2001 on terms that have failed to force Beijing to open its
economy, the Trump administration said on Friday as it prepares
to clamp down on Chinese trade.
    ""It seems clear that the United States erred in supporting
China's entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be
ineffective in securing China's embrace of an open,
market-orientated trade regime,"" the administration said in an
annual report to Congress on China's compliance with WTO
commitments.
    ""It is now clear that the WTO rules are not sufficient to
constrain China's market-distorting behavior,"" the report said.
    While the annual report from the U.S. Trade Representative’s
office has long taken China to task for unfair trade practices,
the first such review under U.S. President Donald Trump takes a
harsher tone against Beijing.
     It comes amid worsening trade tensions between the world's
two largest economies and as the administration prepares actions
to curb China's alleged theft of intellectual property. A
decision in the so-called ""Section 301"" investigation is
expected in the coming weeks.
    The report also points at Russia's behavior, saying Moscow
had no intention of complying with its WTO obligations, a trend
the administration said was ""very troubling.""
    A White House official said despite consultations with
China, it had failed to follow through on promises of moving
more toward a market-orientated economy and playing by
international trading rules.
    ""The president and his principal advisor are united in the
belief that this is a problem that has gone on for too long and
needs to be addressed,"" the official said.
    ""In the past, conversations have focused more on discreet
opening for discreet products, and what we're saying is
systematically we’re not going to tolerate broad-based policy
that attempts to promote state-led enterprises,"" the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    Trump told Reuters in an interview this week he was
considering a big ""fine"" against China for forcing U.S.
companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a
cost of doing business there. [nL1N1PD00B]
    While the administration is also looking at whether foreign
imports of steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels
are harming U.S businesses, China's alleged theft of
intellectual property is a particular concern to Trump because
it affects a large swath of American firms, the official said.
    Trump did not specify what he meant by a ""fine"" against
China, but the 1974 trade law that authorized an investigation
into China’s alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property allows
him to impose retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods or other
trade sanctions until China changes its policies.
    In Beijing, many experts believe Washington is unwilling to
pay the heavy economic price needed to upset prevailing trade
dynamics between the two countries.[nL3N1PA1VF]
    In the report released on Friday, Trump's trade envoy,
Robert Lighthizer, said the global economy was threatened by
major economies who undermined the global trading system.
    ""The global trading system is threatened by major economies
who do not intend to open their markets to trade and participate
fairly,"" Lighthizer said. ""This practice is incompatible with
the market-based approach expressly envisioned by WTO members
and contrary to the fundamental principles of the WTO.""
    The Trump administration has already pledged to transform
164-member trade body and has blocked WTO judicial appointments
in a move to win WTO reforms.
    ""What we want to do is see countries behave responsibly
within the international trading system,"" the White House

""It seems clear that the United States erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing China's embrace of an open, market-orientated trade regime,"" the administration said in an annual report to Congress on China's compliance with WTO commitments. ""It is now clear that the WTO rules are not sufficient to constrain China's market-distorting behavior,"" the report said. While the annual report from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office has long taken China to task for unfair trade practices, the first such review under U.S. President Donald Trump takes a harsher tone against Beijing. It comes amid worsening trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and as the administration prepares actions to curb China's alleged theft of intellectual property. A decision in the so-called ""Section 301"" investigation is expected in the coming weeks. The report also points at Russia's behavior, saying Moscow had no intention of complying with its WTO obligations, a trend the administration said was ""very troubling."" A White House official said despite consultations with China, it had failed to follow through on promises of moving more toward a market-orientated economy and playing by international trading rules. ""The president and his principal advisor are united in the belief that this is a problem that has gone on for too long and needs to be addressed,"" the official said. ""In the past, conversations have focused more on discreet opening for discreet products, and what we're saying is systematically we’re not going to tolerate broad-based policy that attempts to promote state-led enterprises,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump told Reuters in an interview this week he was considering a big ""fine"" against China for forcing U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there. While the administration is also looking at whether foreign imports of steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels are harming U.S businesses, China's alleged theft of intellectual property is a particular concern to Trump because it affects a large swath of American firms, the official said. Trump did not specify what he meant by a ""fine"" against China, but the 1974 trade law that authorized an investigation into China’s alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property allows him to impose retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods or other trade sanctions until China changes its policies. In Beijing, many experts believe Washington is unwilling to pay the heavy economic price needed to upset prevailing trade dynamics between the two countries. In the report released on Friday, Trump's trade envoy, Robert Lighthizer, said the global economy was threatened by major economies who undermined the global trading system. ""The global trading system is threatened by major economies who do not intend to open their markets to trade and participate fairly,"" Lighthizer said. ""This practice is incompatible with the market-based approach expressly envisioned by WTO members and contrary to the fundamental principles of the WTO."" The Trump administration has already pledged to transform 164-member trade body and has blocked WTO judicial appointments in a move to win WTO reforms.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Emboldened by his victory in
the passage of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in decades,
President Donald Trump now wants to rein in social welfare
programs even though some Republicans are wary of tackling the
volatile issue in a congressional election year.
    A White House-led drive to downsize government aid programs
such as food stamps and housing subsidies would energize
conservative campaign donors whose support Republicans are
counting on ahead of the November elections where the party will
fight to keep control of Congress.
    White House aides say Trump is eager to take on welfare. He
has a willing partner in House of Representatives Speaker Paul
Ryan, who has long had an interest in the issue.
    But some Republicans believe Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell is lukewarm on the drive for revising welfare, which
might face a difficult sell in the Senate where Republicans hold
only a razor-thin 51-49 majority.
    Democrats already are attacking Trump for identifying
welfare changes as his top 2018 goal, saying they are designed
to help pay for tax cuts whose benefits are skewed toward
corporations and wealthy individuals and which will add an
estimated $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years.    
    Trump has summoned Republican congressional leaders to the
Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland this weekend to
discuss 2018 priorities, including welfare and a planned effort
on infrastructure investment.    
    Conservative House Republicans are especially enthusiastic
about a welfare overhaul. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows and
the caucus' former leader, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, have
discussed it with Trump and are confident the Republican
president backs their ideas, such as strengthening work
requirements for food stamps.
    ""He definitely gets it,"" Jordan said.
    But Republicans may need to tread carefully in seeking to
reduce government aid programs that benefit some of Trump's core
supporters in poor, rural regions of the country.
    Republican Representative Tom Cole said Congress had a lot
on its plate in the early months of 2018, including must-pass
budget legislation and he was unsure there would be the time -
or political will in the Senate - to pass welfare legislation.
    ""First things first,"" Cole said, adding it might be better
to lay the groundwork for debate over the issue than to try
enacting changes this year.
    Meadows said he believed a welfare overhaul had strong
support among Republican lawmakers but that ""convincing Mitch
McConnell and the Democrats are Herculean tasks.""
    Other Republicans and interest groups such as the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers
think 2018 would be better spent on infrastructure.
    
    TOUGHER THAN TAXES?
    Trump's first major legislative victory - the tax bill -
took until the end of 2017. But handing out tax breaks might be
far easier than revamping welfare assistance that benefits
millions of American families.
    Last year, there were more than 42 million people in nearly
21 million U.S. households receiving Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, which are known as food
stamps, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    They cost taxpayers about $58 billion.
    Trump's budget proposal last year called for cutting more
than $192 billion from SNAP over a decade.
    The president also proposed deep cuts to Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families, which last year provided aid to
1.1 million families.
    Democratic strategist Doug Thornell said a push on welfare
could trigger a political backlash for Republicans from elderly
and blue-collar voters in the November congressional elections.
    Thornell said it may appeal to Trump's political base ""but
few else. And the irony here is that it will be Trump’s base who
will feel the brunt of these cuts.""    
    Robert Doar, a poverty specialist at the
conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute who has been
in contact with Trump administration officials about policy
ideas, urged an incremental approach.
    Although Doar said he did not know what policies the
administration would ultimately back, he said Trump could
encourage people to get jobs by reducing the length of their
qualification for government aid and imposing stricter reviews
of their efforts to find work.
    He said Congress could pass legislation cutting benefits for
people who fail to make enough effort to find jobs or do
volunteer work.
    Some have argued that food stamp beneficiaries, for example,
already include a high rate of people who hold jobs but are
unable to make ends meet.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A NAFTA termination letter
from U.S. President Donald Trump could become the ultimate
sleight of hand from Washington as it seeks to gain negotiating
leverage over Canada and Mexico in talks to update the
24-year-old trade pact.
    While such a letter would start a six-month exit clock
ticking, the United States would not be legally bound to quit
the North American Free Trade Agreement once it expires.
    Unlike the irreversible missile that Britain fired when it
triggered a two-year countdown to its exit from the European
Union last March, quitting NAFTA would still be optional for
Trump. And an exit would almost certainly face court challenges
over Trump's authority to leave without consent from Congress.
    Canadian government sources told Reuters on Wednesday that
they are increasingly convinced that Trump will soon announce
the U.S. intention to pull out of NAFTA. The news sent Canadian
and Mexican currencies lower and hurt stocks across the
continent. [nL1N1P51PA] 
    Sending a termination letter would allow Trump, who has been
frustrated with Mexican and Canadian reluctance to meet
aggressive U.S. demands on the sourcing of automotive parts and
on dispute settlement, to take a key step toward meeting his
campaign promise of quitting NAFTA if it cannot be revised to
shrink U.S. trade deficits. 
    ""He can gain political mileage out of a big announcement to
quit NAFTA without actually doing it,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a
senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics who has written extensively on NAFTA
termination issues.
    ""He could say that he'll withdraw from NAFTA sometime after
the six-month deadline if we don't get better results in the
negotiations,"" Hufbauer said.
    Using a withdrawal letter in this manner fits in with a
scenario that some industry lobbyists and trade observers say is
increasingly likely: If there's no deal after two more scheduled
negotiating rounds in late January and March, NAFTA talks would
be put on hold for several months as Mexico's presidential
election campaign gets under way.
    By the time talks resume, the withdrawal threat could have
more potency as a negotiating tactic.
    NAFTA's Article 2205 states: ""A party may withdraw from this
agreement six months after it provides written notice of
withdrawal to the other parties. If a party withdraws, the
agreement shall remain in force for the remaining parties.""
    The president would be then free to declare the restoration
of U.S. tariffs to levels agreed at the World Trade
Organization, although experts say that Canada would revert to
the terms of a 1987 U.S. trade agreement that predated NAFTA.   
    Any move by Trump to invoke this clause is almost certain to
be met with immediate legal challenges from U.S. business groups
that would argue that congressional consent would be required
because the U.S. Constitution grants Congress authority over
trade matters.
    In recent weeks, Republican lawmakers have been raising
increasing concerns about the dangers of quitting NAFTA,
particularly in U.S. farm states that count Mexico as their
biggest grains customer. 
    On Wednesday, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue
called quitting NAFTA a ""grave mistake"" that would send the U.S.
economy ""five steps back."" [nL1N1P514S]
    Because implementing legislation would remain on the books,
many provisions of NAFTA would still be active, including trade
and investment dispute arbitration systems that the Trump
administration wants to change. 
    ""I think this is headed for a huge legal morass if the
president were to unilaterally send a notice of withdrawal,""
Jennifer Hillman, a Georgetown University law professor and
former WTO appellate judge, told Reuters in November.

    MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Talks in Montreal
later this month to update the North American Free Trade
Agreement will be extended by one day, officials said on
Thursday, as Mexico and the United States exchanged barbs.
    The negotiations have bogged down as Canada and Mexico
resist radical demands from the United States to revise the
rules governing one of the world's largest trading blocs.
    U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to abandon NAFTA
unless major changes are made to the 1994 treaty.
    Negotiators had originally been due to meet from Jan. 23 to
28, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Mexican
Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign
Minister Chrystia Freeland joining on the final day of the
penultimate round of talks. They will now do so on Jan. 29
instead.
    Canada's foreign ministry confirmed the shift in dates after
   Canadian and Mexican sources said the three ministers could
not meet on Jan. 28 because of logistical reasons.
    Prospects for the talks are unclear. Trump told Reuters on
Wednesday that terminating NAFTA would result in the ""best deal""
to revamp the pact, which he blames for Mexico's large trade
surplus with the United States. pnL1N1PD00C]
    Trump is also insistent that Mexico pay for a wall he wants
to have erected along the southern U.S. border, a demand he
repeated on Thursday. [nL1N1PD0EP]
    Mexican Finance Minister Finance Minister Jose Antonio
Gonzalez Anaya on Thursday reiterated his government’s
opposition to the idea.
    ""Mexico will not pay for a wall and it's not a negotiating
stance from Mexico – it's an issue of national sovereignty and
dignity,"" he told reporters after talks with Canadian Finance
Minister Bill Morneau in Toronto.
    ""Our position has been clear from the beginning and will
continue to be clear,"" he added.
    Morneau, asked how Canada's government would support
businesses if Trump announced the United States was pulling out,
said Ottawa was focused on ""making sure we continue to be
constructive at the table and get to a better NAFTA agreement.""

The negotiations have bogged down as Canada and Mexico resist radical demands from the United States to revise the rules governing one of the world's largest trading blocs. U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to abandon NAFTA unless major changes are made to the 1994 treaty. Negotiators had originally been due to meet from Jan. 23 to 28, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland joining on the final day of the penultimate round of talks. They will now do so on Jan. 29 instead. Canada's foreign ministry confirmed the shift in dates after Canadian and Mexican sources said the three ministers could not meet on Jan. 28 because of logistical reasons. Prospects for the talks are unclear. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that terminating NAFTA would result in the ""best deal"" to revamp the pact, which he blames for Mexico's large trade surplus with the United States. pnL1N1PD00C] Trump is also insistent that Mexico pay for a wall he wants to have erected along the southern U.S. border, a demand he repeated on Thursday. Mexican Finance Minister Finance Minister Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya on Thursday reiterated his government’s opposition to the idea. ""Mexico will not pay for a wall and it's not a negotiating stance from Mexico – it's an issue of national sovereignty and dignity,"" he told reporters after talks with Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Toronto. ""Our position has been clear from the beginning and will continue to be clear,"" he added. Morneau, asked how Canada's government would support businesses if Trump announced the United States was pulling out, said Ottawa was focused on ""making sure we continue to be constructive at the table and get to a better NAFTA agreement.""",talk montreal later month update north american free trade agreement extend one day officials thursday mexico unite state exchange barb negotiations bogged canada mexico resist radical demand unite state revise rule govern one worlds largest trade blocs threaten abandon nafta unless major change make 1994 treaty negotiators originally due meet jan 23 28 trade representative robert lighthizer mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland join final day penultimate round talk jan 29 instead canadas foreign ministry confirm shift date canadian mexican source three minister could meet jan 28 logistical reason prospect talk unclear tell reuters wednesday terminate nafta result best deal revamp pact blame mexicos large trade surplus unite state pnl1n1pd00c also insistent mexico pay wall want erect along southern border demand repeat thursday mexican finance minister finance minister jose antonio gonzalez anaya thursday reiterate governments opposition idea mexico pay wall negotiate stance mexico issue national sovereignty dignity tell reporters talk canadian finance minister bill morneau toronto position clear begin continue clear add morneau ask canadas government support businesses announce unite state pull ottawa focus make sure continue constructive table get better nafta agreement

    BRUSSELS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Europe and the United States
should confront Tehran about its ballistic weapons programme and
its role in Syria's civil war but a 2015 deal to prevent Iran
from developing a nuclear bomb must be preserved, Germany's
foreign minister said on Thursday.
    Speaking before a meeting with his counterparts from Iran,
Britain and France and the European Union, Sigmar Gabriel said
the United States was right to address concerns about Iran's
strategy in the Middle East.
    But he said: ""We should separate two things from each other:
we want to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran... and the
difficult role Iran has in the region.""
    ""We want to speak with Iran about its role in the region,
which is more than problematic,"" he said, citing Iran's
influence in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. 
    On the eve of a deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump to
decide whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the
agreement, the EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini convened the
meeting with the European powers to show support for the nuclear
deal in a message to Washington, diplomats and officials said.
    Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear arms.
    British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in a statement
released before the start of the meeting in Brussels, called the
nuclear deal ""a crucial agreement that makes the world safer."" 
    Trump's October decision not to certify Iran's compliance
with the nuclear deal has put Washington at odds with all other
signatories of the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia,
China and the European Union.
    European allies have warned of a split with the United
States over the nuclear agreement and say if Washington
reimposes sanctions on Iran, the pact could fall apart.
    Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving
U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports under the terms of the
pact. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday the Trump
administration was expected to decide on Friday. [nS0N1O400B]
    The decision comes as Iran's government deals with protests
over economic hardships and corruption that are linked to
frustration among younger Iranians who hoped to see more
benefits from the lifting of sanctions.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Chinese automaker GAC
Automobiles' plan to sell vehicles in the United States ran
afoul of Washington trade politics on Wednesday, as the top U.S.
Senate Democrat and U.S. President Donald Trump separately
criticized Chinese trade practices.
    GAC Automobiles, formally known as Guangzhou Automobile
Group Co Ltd <601238.SS>, said Monday it plans to start selling
vehicles in the United States in late 2019, potentially through
a partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI>. The
southern Chinese automaker initially said it had hoped to start
selling vehicles in the United States in 2017.
    On Wednesday, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York
Democrat, cited GAC's plans announced in Detroit on the Senate
floor Wednesday and argued that Chinese automotive trade rules
are ""manifestly unfair, and a typically unfortunate example of
China’s rapacious trading policies.""
    Chinese-built cars shipped to the United States face just a
2.5 percent tariff, while U.S.-built cars sent to China are hit
with a 25 percent tariff. 
     Trump told Reuters in an interview Wednesday that ""we have
helped to build China because they have taken out so much money
in terms of trade deficits with this country.""
    He said that ""when China or another country charges us 50
percent tariffs – more than that in some cases – and we charge
them nothing, that’s not fair. That’s not fair.""
    While Schumer and Trump have clashed on many issues, the
interests of Democrats and the Republican president are more
aligned on automotive trade. Both want to win votes from auto
workers in industrial states such as Michigan or Ohio whose jobs
could be threatened should Chinese vehicles come to the United
States in high volume. Leaders of the United Auto Workers union
regularly raise concerns about U.S.-China automotive trade.
    In 2016, General Motors Co <GM.N> became the first major
automaker to sell a Chinese-made vehicle in the United States,
importing its Buick Envision. GM sold 41,000 of the small SUVs
in 2017.
    Volvo Cars, a unit of Chinese automaker Geely Automobile
Holdings Ltd <0175.HK>, has also been exporting vehicles from
China to the United States since 2016. In June, Ford Motor Co
<F.N> said it would move some production of its Focus small car
to China from Mexico and import the vehicles to the United
States by 2019.
    GAC could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday
but confirmed this week it planned to change the name of
vehicles sold in the United States from its flagship brand,
Trumpchi to avoid confusion with Trump. It also plans to
eventually sell vehicles in Europe. [nL3N1HS4FP]

    LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
visited the new $1 billion U.S. embassy in London on Monday,
just days after his boss Donald Trump criticised the move to new
diplomatic premises as part of a bad deal agreed by the
administration of Barack Obama.
    Trump earlier this month cancelled a trip to London to open
the new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal
agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for
""peanuts"". [nL8N1P70ZL]
    Tillerson was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Woody Johnson as
workmen finished planting shrubs in the grounds of the new
embassy. America's top diplomat then met some of the marines who
are stationed at the embassy.
    ""The embassy actually, is gonna really work,"" U.S.
Ambassador Johnson said ahead of Tillerson's arrival.
    Asked when there would be a ribbon cutting ceremony,
Ambassador Johnson said: ""At some point we're going to do it,
but there's no urgency to that. We'll do it when the time is
right.""
    The decision to move the U.S. Embassy from its current
Grosvenor Square location in the exclusive Mayfair area of
London and to a site on the south bank of the Thames was agreed
in 2008 under the presidency of George W. Bush. 
    The American flag was this month removed from Grosvenor
Square where the U.S. embassy has been based since 1938 with the
area known as ""Little America"" during World War Two, when the
square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight
D. Eisenhower. [nL8N1OD3ZQ]
    The new embassy is a veritable fortress set back at least
100 feet (30 metres) from surrounding buildings - mostly
newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating
living quarters for U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside.
    The $1 billion construction was funded by the sale of other
properties in London.

Mexican chief negotiators)
    By David Ljunggren and Anthony Esposito
    MONTREAL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S., Canadian and Mexican
officials opened a key round of negotiations to modernize NAFTA
on Tuesday as President Donald Trump, who has regularly
threatened to quit the trade pact, said the talks were going
""pretty well.""
    Trump, vowing to undo what he portrays as disastrous trade
deals, has in recent days expressed different views of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, stoking investor worries that one
of the world's largest trading blocs may be disrupted.
    With time running out to address U.S. demands for major
changes to the 1994 deal, officials met in a Montreal hotel for
the sixth and penultimate round of talks, which are to conclude
by the end of March to avoid a clash with Mexico's elections.
    ""We have come to Montreal with a lot of new ideas, a lot of
creative strategies to try to bridge some of the gaps in the
negotiations,"" Canadian chief negotiator Steve Verheul told
reporters, adding that he had ""high hopes"" of progress.
    Insiders say the Canadian and Mexican governments are
prepared to be flexible on a U.S. demand that the amount of
North American content in autos be boosted to qualify for
duty-free status in NAFTA.
    But Ottawa and Mexico City strongly oppose the proposal that
autos produced on the continent should have 50 percent U.S.
content. Differences also remain over how to address the U.S.
push for changes to various dispute resolution mechanisms.
    Trump, who has blamed NAFTA for the loss of U.S. jobs, told
White House reporters on Tuesday the talks were going ""pretty
well.""
    The Mexican peso immediately pared losses on his
comments.[nE1N1MM008]    
    Mexico's chief negotiator Ken Smith said he hoped progress
could be made on less contentious areas such as
telecommunications, anti-corruption and sanitary and
phytosanitary measures.
    Many Canadian officials, however, are downbeat about the
talks amid uncertainty over whether Washington really wants to
negotiate.
    ""If you're unsure where the other side wants to go it is
really difficult to know what would please them unless you
capitulate, and that's not going to happen,"" one person briefed
on Ottawa's negotiating stance said on condition of anonymity.
    With NAFTA's future up in the air, Canada is taking steps to
diversify its trade. Canada currently sends 75 percent of its
goods exports to the United States.
    Earlier on Tuesday, Canada and 10 other nations agreed to
sign a reworked Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. The United
States pulled out of an earlier version of that
deal.[nL4N1PI3MD]
    Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Canada
Economics, said the TPP deal might give Canada ""a slightly
stronger hand to play in the current NAFTA negotiations.""
    Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is currently
attending the World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland to
drum up investment. Next month he will spend five days in India,
which Canada sees as potentially a bigger trading partner.

Trump, who has blamed NAFTA for the loss of U.S. jobs, told White House reporters on Tuesday the talks were going ""pretty well."" The Mexican peso immediately pared losses on his comments. Mexico's chief negotiator Ken Smith said he hoped progress could be made on less contentious areas such as telecommunications, anti-corruption and sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Many Canadian officials, however, are downbeat about the talks amid uncertainty over whether Washington really wants to negotiate. ""If you're unsure where the other side wants to go it is really difficult to know what would please them unless you capitulate, and that's not going to happen,"" one person briefed on Ottawa's negotiating stance said on condition of anonymity. With NAFTA's future up in the air, Canada is taking steps to diversify its trade. Canada currently sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States. Earlier on Tuesday, Canada and 10 other nations agreed to sign a reworked Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. The United States pulled out of an earlier version of that deal. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Canada Economics, said the TPP deal might give Canada ""a slightly stronger hand to play in the current NAFTA negotiations.""

    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Swiss Alpine town
of Davos is used to celebrities and high-rollers, but even it is
relishing new attention being heaped on it with U.S. President
Donald Trump's decision to attend the World Economic Forum this
month
    Trump's visit to Davos for the annual meet-up of global
political and business leaders will be the first for a sitting
U.S. president since Bill Clinton came in 2000.
    Trump's policies, including his intention to exit the 2015
Paris climate accord and his ""America First"" tendencies, may not
sit well with all of Switzerland, which backs the global climate
pact and whose economy relies on global trade. 
    This has prompted some critics to suggest Trump's polarising
persona could resurrect violent anti-WEF protests from the early
2000s. An online petition is circulating telling Trump he is not
welcome. 
    Still, the tenor in Davos this week Thursday was upbeat,
with many confident a robust security contingent -- up to 5,000
soldiers if necessary alongside about 1,000 police -- can handle
any furore surrounding Trump's presence.
    ""It doesn't get any better than this,"" said Ernst Wyrsch,
who was director of the hotel where Clinton stayed during his
WEF visit and now heads the region's hotel association.
    ""Davos, for at least a couple of days, will be at the centre
of the world."" 
    While dignitaries come each year -- British Prime Minister
Theresa May and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping made the trek to the
town last year -- they lack the media power of a U.S. president
that puts the spotlight on a community that relies on tourism.
    ""I guess there's no such thing as bad publicity,"" said
Linard Kinschi, a resident who was heading out to the 1,560
meters above sea level (5,120 ft) town's cross-country ski
trails. 
    Although U.S. officials are already in Switzerland preparing
for Trump's arrival, details of his trip, including whether he
will even spend the night during the Jan. 23-26 event, were
under wraps.
    Trump, expected to be accompanied by Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin and possibly Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, may
rush in for a day, give a speech and then depart.
    There is something of a contradiction in all this.
    The WEF is a haven for supporters of globalisation who
espousing the very free trade pacts that Trump has blasted as
unfair to the United States.
    Heinz Brand, who represents Davos in the Swiss parliament,
hopes Trump arrives in the mood for discussion, not a fight.
    ""Even people who were sworn enemies have met in Davos and
left on more favourable terms,"" Brand said, recalling when
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres shared a WEF stage.
    
    CHANGES
    The Swiss army has begun erecting checkpoints on roads
leading into town and armed hillside bivouacs down the valley,
scenes on par with every post-Sept. 11 WEF where security has
been to the fore. 
    ""This is the 48th WEF,"" said Reto Branschi, CEO of Davos
Klosters Tourism. ""Every year, we have 20 presidents from all
over the world. We are used to the visits of presidents.""
    Last year, 4,300 Swiss soldiers deployed, with the airspace
open only to aircraft ferrying participants to the forum.
Grisons cantonal police, who coordinate WEF security measures
and are liaising with U.S. officials, say they are ready.
    ""The closure of the airspace has worked well in recent
years, and we don't believe that any modifications will be
necessary this year,"" said Andre Kraske, a Grisons spokesman.
    Still, there are some changes. 
    For decades, helicopters carrying visitors have landed in
the meadow of Hans Stiffler, a lifelong Davoser who runs an inn.
    This year, the landing pad has been moved across the valley,
where there is more room.
    Without choppers at the doorstep this year, it will be a bit
quieter, and Stiffler will not have to bring his security badge
with him every time he leaves home.
    But he may also not be able to add to his trove of WEF
memorabilia includes letters of appreciation from Clinton,
photos of former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, and an
intimate shot of then Brazilian president Lula da Silva meeting
Israel's Peres in Stiffler's hotel for five minutes before each
was helicoptered away.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Political danger signs are
flashing, but conservatives in Washington are pushing forward
with proposals to change America's social safety net, an agenda
even fellow Republican President Donald Trump recently shied
away from.
    Fresh from a tax overhaul victory and keen to act while they
retain control of Congress, Republicans are calling for tougher
work and job training requirements for those helped by
assistance programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.
[nL1N1OZ1Z5]
    Such ideas appeal strongly to conservative Republican
voters, although more broadly, Americans' strong views and
personal stakes in social programs have long been seen as
political dynamite - especially in election years.
    ""That is fraught with danger, political danger,"" said John
Feehery, a Republican strategist who served as spokesman to
former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
    After the deep tax cuts for corporations that Republicans
pushed through Congress in December, critics will say the party
wants to ""pay for it by slashing benefits to poor people. They
just don't need that right now,"" Feehery said.
    In November, Republicans must defend their Senate and House
majorities in nationwide midterm congressional elections, which
historically produce big gains for the opposition in the first
term of a new presidency. 
    Trump said on Saturday after a meeting with Republican
leaders that any legislation on welfare reform should be
bipartisan or wait until later in 2018 after other priorities
such as infrastructure and immigration are addressed.
    Some House Republicans interpreted Trump's statement as
taking off the table any overhauls of big programs such as
Social Security and the Medicare program for the elderly, but
not an impediment to more modest initiatives such as stricter
work requirements.
    House Speaker Paul Ryan has long advocated some of the
welfare changes that Republicans are trying to decide how to
package.
    ""What we will see is perhaps a more focused approach, to a
work requirement, instead of a comprehensive entitlement reform
initiative,"" Representative Mark Meadows said in an interview.
Meadows is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative
faction.
    The Trump administration itself advanced safety-net changes
on Thursday, telling states they could move toward imposing work
or job training requirements on people as a condition for health
insurance under Medicaid, a government program that provides
health coverage to millions of Americans, primarily the poor,
children, pregnant women, elderly adults and disabled people.
Kentucky on Friday became the first state to received federal
government approval to implement such requirements.
[nL1N1P6160][nL1N1P71CS]
    In an example of what such proposals invite, Democrats
quickly attacked the move. ""It's really sad. ... The elderly,
disabled, pregnant women and children will all suffer,"" House
Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters.
    A person familiar with the meeting last weekend at Camp
David, the president's mountain retreat in Maryland, between
Trump and congressional leaders said some participants were wary
of ""welfare reform"" as a Republican message.
    Still, polling in mid-2017 by the Kaiser Family Foundation
found 70 percent of respondents favored work requirements for
Medicaid for non-disabled adults. At the same time, 74 percent
said they had a favorable view of Medicaid as it is now.
    House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, a Texas
Republican, said the 2018 farm bill will including tighter work
requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP), better known as food stamps. He gave no details.
    House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady, also a Texas
Republican, said his panel is exploring ways to get workers who
are ""trapped in the welfare system ... off the sidelines.""
    Representative Bradley Byrne, an Alabama Republican, said
safety net programs are under review by a bipartisan group he
co-chairs called the Opportunity Action Caucus. He said he hoped
the group this month would propose ways for ""able-bodied people
who are presently on one or more of our welfare programs, to go
out and get the skills and training they need to get a job.""

factory in the United States this month, a top executive said on
Wednesday, as it awaits a U.S. government decision on curbing
imports of washers.
    The U.S. International Trade Commision recommended in
November tariffs to keep Samsung and its home rival LG

and impair job creation at its $380 million plant in South
Carolina, which was announced in June to produce washing

    U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision
on the recommendation early this year. 
    When asked about whether the plant will begin operations
this month, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Yoon Boo-keun
confirmed the plan to reporters on Wednesday. He did not
elaborate. 
    The plant, Samsung's first U.S. appliances factory in more

    WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said
on Thursday it would allow states to test requiring some
Medicaid recipients to work or participate in community
activities such as volunteering or jobs training as a condition
of eligibility for the government health insurance program for
the poor.
    The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued
guidance making it easier for states to design and propose test
programs that implement such requirements. States must propose
such changes through waivers and receive federal approval.
    Seema Verma, the agency's administrator, said the policy
guidance came in response to requests from at least 10 states
that have proposed requiring some Medicaid recipients to work or
participate in activities that may include skills training,
education, job search, volunteering or caregiving. Those states
include Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Arizona, Indiana and
Utah. 
    Certain Medicaid populations would be exempt from the rules,
including those with disabilities, the elderly, children and
pregnant women. Verma also said states would have to make
""reasonable modifications"" for those battling opioid addiction
and other substance use disorders.
    ""This gives us a pathway to start approving waivers,"" Verma
said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. ""This is about
helping those individuals rise out of poverty.""
    Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic
President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement
commonly known as Obamacare, 31 states expanded Medicaid to
those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level,
adding millions of people to the rolls. 
    Republicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace
Obamacare, a top campaign promise of President Donald Trump.
Instead, the Trump administration has sought to weaken the
program through executive orders and administrative rules. 
    The Obama administration opposed state efforts to implement
work requirements in Medicaid because it could result in fewer
people having access to health insurance. 
    For instance, Kentucky last year proposed work requirements
for able-bodied adults to get insurance and establishing new
fees for all members based on income. A study found the proposal
would reduce the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly
86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.
    Republicans argue that Medicaid was created to serve the
most vulnerable and has become bloated under Obamacare. Verma
and other Republicans said implementing work and community
engagement requirements could help improve health outcomes by
connecting people with jobs and training.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader
Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he was optimistic bipartisan
talks on immigration and government funding would lead to a deal
and he strongly prefers an agreement before Feb. 8, when the
current funding expires.
    The day after President Donald Trump said he was open to
granting a path to citizenship to illegal immigrants known as
""Dreamers"" who were brought to the United States as children, a
key Democratic priority, McConnell said he looked forward to the
unveiling of a White House framework on immigration next week. 
    ""I'm optimistic these ongoing negotiations will lead to
results,"" McConnell said of talks involving a group of about
three dozen senators.
    McConnell also restated his pledge to proceed to a debate
and vote on immigration and border security in the Senate if a
long-term agreement eludes the chamber by Feb. 8, as long as the
government stays open.
    Earlier this week, he convinced Democrats to support the
reopening of government after a weekend shutdown by promising to
take up an immigration bill protecting an estimated 700,000
""Dreamers"" from deportation.
    ""The bill I choose to introduce will have an amendment
process that will ensure a level playing field at the outset,""
he said, pledging to be ""fair to all sides.""
    Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that
his immigration framework would seek $25 billion for a border
wall with Mexico, $5 billion for other border security programs,
measures to curb family sponsorship of immigrants, and an
overhaul of or end to the visa lottery system.
    In exchange, he said he wanted to offer the Dreamers
protection from deportation and an ""incentive"" of citizenship,
perhaps in 10 to 12 years.
    ""We're going to solve the problem. It's up to the Democrats,
but they (the Dreamers) should not be concerned,"" Trump said.
    Trump, whose hardline immigration stance was a key part of
his 2016 presidential campaign, announced in September he was
ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program
created by Democratic predecessor Barack Obama unless Congress
came up with a new law.
    Despite Trump's remarks, Democrats remained cautious ahead
of the unveiling of the White House framework.
    ""The White House unfortunately has proven unreliable and
wildly unpredictable,"" Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer
said on the Senate floor. ""Within the course of hours they say
different things. Every time the president moves forward on one
thing, his staff pulls him back and undoes what he says.""
    Schumer urged the bipartisan group of senators to keep
meeting and reach a ""narrow"" deal on the Dreamers and border
security.
    ""As we found time and again, when we open up the
negotiations to discussions of broad immigration reform, there
is no end to what each party says could be on the table,""
Schumer said.
    John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a key
negotiator, said Trump's comments ""surprised a lot of people""
but displayed the president's eagerness for a permanent
solution.
    ""What he didn't talk about and what I want to hear from him
on is the rest of the requirement, on border security, on
diversity lottery and on chain migration,"" Cornyn told
reporters.
    ""If we’re going to have a permanent solution on DACA
recipients then we need a permanent solution on border security.
Which means not only a plan but the funds front-loaded to pay
for it.""

    BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are more
confident China will further open up to foreign investment in
coming years, a top business lobby said on Tuesday, but it
cautioned that an ""astounding"" three-quarters of its members do
not feel welcomed by the Chinese government.
    The American Chamber of Commerce in China also said in a
report on its annual membership survey ""even-handed enforcement
of laws and regulations regardless of shareholder nationality""
and an open investment environment were needed to reduce trade
frictions between China and the United States.
    ""After several years of contraction, more companies are
expanding investment, yet the growth in investment will remain
much slower than historical levels,"" the chamber said.
    The outlook on sustainable economic growth in China was
""generally positive"", with 46 percent of respondents expressing
confidence that the government would further open China's market
to foreign investment within the next three years, up from 34
percent in the previous survey, it said.
    But the chamber noted that its survey, filled out during
October and November by 411 of the 849 members to whom it was
sent, did not include ""countless"" companies because they are
excluded from China's market by government regulations.
    It cautioned that U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to
China in November might account for a jump in perceptions that
U.S.-China relations would improve in the year ahead – 36
percent compared with 17 percent in the previous year's survey.
    
    TRUMP'S HARDER LINE
    Trump has taken a hard line on China since that visit, which
yielded no major outcomes on trade disputes, saying that he was
considering major action against Beijing for alleged theft of
intellectual property. [nL1N1PD08W] 
    His administration has said the United States mistakenly
supported China's membership in the World Trade Organization in
2001 on terms that had failed to force Beijing to open its
economy. [nL1N1PE227]
    ""There is a sense that strictly just dialogue has not really
brought much in terms of progress. So perhaps some pressure will
help get us more progress to a more balanced economic,
commercial relationship,"" the chamber's chairman William Zarit
told reporters when asked about the possibility of Trump
imposing further tariffs on China.
    Forty-six percent of respondents listed either stronger
advocacy for a level playing field or applying ""investment
reciprocity as an approach to improve market access"" as the top
two ways the U.S. government could help foreign businesses in
China.
    The third most common response, at 14 percent, was pursuing
multilateral regional free trade and investment agreements, such
as the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal from which the Trump
administration withdrew.
    Fifty-nine percent of companies in technology and research
and development-intensive sectors, in which Beijing has unveiled
an ambitious Made In China 2025 plan to supplant foreign
products, said they were treated unfairly compared to domestic
companies, according to the survey.
    ""We see numerous policies that hamper foreign-invested
companies, and also major market distortions being permitted in
order to force technology transfer,"" the chamber report cited an
unidentified senior executive in the agribusiness sector as
saying.

    By Susan Cornwell and Yasmeen Abutaleb
    WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Political danger signs are
flashing, but conservatives in Washington are pushing forward
with proposals to change America's social safety net, an agenda
even fellow Republican President Donald Trump recently shied
away from.
    Fresh from a tax overhaul victory and keen to act while they
retain control of Congress, Republicans are seeking tougher work
and job training requirements for those helped by assistance
programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. [nL1N1OZ1Z5]
    Kentucky on Friday became the first U.S. state to get
approval from Washington to impose work requirements on
recipients of Medicaid, a government program that provides
health coverage to millions of Americans, primarily the poor,
children, pregnant women, elderly adults and disabled people.
    The approval came a day after the Trump administration said
states could move toward putting work or job training conditions
on Medicaid, which has never had such conditions attached.
[nL1N1P6160][nL1N1P71CS]
    Democrats and health advocacy groups said such changes would
make healthcare less accessible to vulnerable Americans.
    The Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal group, said it
plans to file a legal challenge against the administration.
    Changes like Kentucky's appeal to conservative Republican
voters, although more broadly, Americans' strong views and
personal stakes in U.S. social programs have long been seen as
political dynamite - especially in election years.
    ""That is fraught with danger, political danger,"" said John
Feehery, a Republican strategist who served as spokesman to
former Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
    After the deep tax cuts for corporations that Republicans
pushed through Congress in December, critics will say the party
wants to ""pay for it by slashing benefits to poor people. They
just don't need that right now,"" Feehery said.
    In November, Republicans must defend their Senate and House
majorities in nationwide midterm congressional elections, which
historically produce big gains for the opposition in the first
term of a new presidency. 
    Trump said on Saturday after a meeting with Republican
leaders that any welfare legislation should be bipartisan or
wait until later in 2018 after other priorities such as
infrastructure and immigration are addressed.
    Some House Republicans interpreted Trump's statement as
ruling out overhauls of big programs such as Social Security and
the Medicare program for the elderly, but leaving room for more
modest initiatives such as stricter work requirements.
[nL1N1OZ1Z5]
    
    RYAN'S AGENDA
    House Speaker Paul Ryan, the Republican Party's policy wonk
in chief, has long advocated for some of the welfare changes
that party colleagues are trying to decide how to package.
    ""What we will see is perhaps a more focused approach, to a
work requirement, instead of a comprehensive entitlement reform
initiative,"" North Carolina Republican Representative Mark
Meadows said in an interview. He is chairman of the House
Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction.
    In an example of what such proposals invite, Democrats
quickly attacked the administration's decision to let states
proceed with Medicaid work requirements.
    ""It's really sad. ... The elderly, disabled, pregnant women
and children will all suffer,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy
Pelosi told reporters.
    A person familiar with a meeting last weekend at Camp David,
the president's mountain retreat in Maryland, between Trump and
congressional leaders said some participants were wary of making
""welfare reform"" a Republican message.
    Still, polling in mid-2017 by the Kaiser Family Foundation
found 70 percent of respondents favored work requirements for
Medicaid for non-disabled adults. At the same time, 74 percent
said they had a favorable view of Medicaid as it is now.
    House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, a Texas
Republican, said the 2018 farm bill will including tighter work
requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP), better known as food stamps. He gave no details.
    House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady, also a Texas
Republican, said his panel is exploring ways to get workers who
are ""trapped in the welfare system ... off the sidelines.""
    Representative Bradley Byrne, an Alabama Republican, said
safety net programs are under review by a bipartisan group he
co-chairs called the Opportunity Action Caucus. He said he hoped
the group this month would propose ways for ""able-bodied people
who are presently on one or more of our welfare programs, to go
out and get the skills and training they need to get a job.""

measures, changes date)
    By John Miller
    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Swiss Alpine town
of Davos is used to celebrities and high-rollers, but even it is
relishing the new challenge posed by U.S. President Donald
Trump's decision to attend the World Economic Forum this month.
    Trump's visit to Davos for the annual meet-up of global
political and business leaders will be the first by a sitting
U.S. president since Bill Clinton came in 2000.
    Trump's policies, including his intention to exit the 2015
Paris climate accord and his ""America First"" policy, may not sit
well with all of Switzerland, which backs the global climate
pact and whose economy relies on global trade. 
    This has prompted some critics to suggest Trump's polarising
persona could resurrect the violent anti-WEF protests seen in
the early 2000s. An online petition is circulating telling Trump
he is not welcome. 
    Still, the tenor in Davos this week was upbeat, with many
confident that a robust security contingent -- up to 5,000
soldiers if necessary alongside about 1,000 police -- can handle
any furore surrounding Trump's presence.
    ""It doesn't get any better than this,"" said Ernst Wyrsch,
who was director of the hotel where Clinton stayed during his
WEF visit and now heads the region's hotel association.
    ""Davos, for at least a couple of days, will be at the centre
of the world."" 
    While dignitaries come each year -- British Prime Minister
Theresa May and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping made the trek to the
town last year -- they lack the media pulling power of a U.S.
president that throws a spotlight on a community reliant on
tourism.
    ""I guess there's no such thing as bad publicity,"" said
Linard Kinschi, a resident who was heading out to the 1,560
meters above sea level (5,120 ft) town's cross-country ski
trails. 
    Although U.S. officials are already in Switzerland preparing
for Trump's arrival, details of his trip such as whether he will
even spend the night during the Jan. 23-26 event, were under
wraps.
    Trump, whose entourage will include Treasury Secretary Steve
Mnuchin, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Commerce Secretary
Wilbur Ross and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, may drop in
for just a a day, give a speech and then depart. [nL1N1P622L]
    There is something of a contradiction in all this.
    The WEF is a haven for supporters of globalisation espousing
the very free trade pacts that Trump has blasted as unfair to
the United States.
    Heinz Brand, who represents Davos in the Swiss parliament,
hopes Trump arrives in the mood for discussion, not a fight.
    ""Even people who were sworn enemies have met in Davos and
left on more favourable terms,"" Brand said, recalling a time
when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres shared a WEF stage.
    
    CHANGES
    The Swiss army has begun erecting checkpoints on roads
leading into town and armed hillside bivouacs down the valley,
scenes to those of previous post-Sept. 11 WEF meetings where
security has been to the fore. 
    ""This is the 48th WEF,"" said Reto Branschi, CEO of Davos
Klosters Tourism. ""Every year, we have 20 presidents from all
over the world. We are used to the visits of presidents.""
    Last year, 4,300 Swiss soldiers deployed, with the airspace
open only to aircraft ferrying participants to the forum.
Grisons cantonal police, who coordinate WEF's $9.3 million
security measures and are liaising with U.S. officials, say they
are ready.
    ""The closure of the airspace has worked well in recent
years, and we don't believe that any modifications will be
necessary this year,"" said Andre Kraske, a Grisons spokesman.
    Still, there are some changes. 
    For decades, helicopters carrying visitors have landed in
the meadow of Hans Stiffler, a lifelong Davoser who runs an inn.
    This year, the landing pad has been moved across the valley,
where there is more room.
    Without choppers at the doorstep this year, it will be a bit
quieter, and Stiffler will not have to pick up his security
badge with him every time he leaves home.
    But he may also not be able to add to his trove of WEF
memorabilia which includes letters of appreciation from Clinton,
photos of former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, and an
intimate shot of Brazilian then-President Lula da Silva meeting
Israel's Peres in Stiffler's hotel for five minutes before each
was helicoptered away.

    By Noah Barkin  and Yara Bayoumy
    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A day after sending
the dollar reeling with comments supportive of a weak U.S.
currency, U.S Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump
administration was not seeking trade wars but would defend its
economic interests.
    At a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Mnuchin played down his comments on Wednesday that a weaker
dollar was ""good for us as it relates to trade and
opportunities"", saying they had been ""balanced and consistent"".
    The remarks were seen by markets as a departure from
traditional U.S. currency policy and a sign that U.S. President
Donald Trump is stepping up his attack on China and other big
trading partners as part of his ""America First"" agenda. 
    ""I thought my comment on the dollar was actually quite clear
yesterday,"" Mnuchin told reporters. ""I thought it was actually
balanced and consistent with what I've said before, which is, we
are not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term.""
    Mnuchin said there were ""both advantages and disadvantages
of where the dollar is in the short-term"" and stressed that the
United States wanted fair economic competition.
    ""We want free and fair and reciprocal trade. So I think it's
very clear. We're not looking to get into trade wars. On the
other hand we are looking to defend America's interests.""     
    After Mnuchin's remarks on Wednesday, Commerce Secretary
Wilbur Ross denied that his colleague was advocating a weaker
dollar, but when asked about the risk of trade wars, he told
CNBC: ""Trade war has been in place for quite a little while, the
difference is the U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts.""  
     Speaking at the Thursday morning news conference, Ross
said: ""People are using some predatory practices against us and
we're not flinching from that.""
    
    TRUMP SPEECH
    The comments came a day after European leaders, without
specifically mentioning the United States, warned against a rise
in nationalism and protectionism.
    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a
regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday that the country's
leaders were committed to openness.
    ""I believe everyone has already noticed that at the end of
last year China has taken real steps to greatly loosen its
financial industry, market access and others,"" she said.
    Trump, who landed in Zurich on Thursday morning on his way
to Davos, is expected to promote his ""America First"" policies in
a speech at the forum on Friday.
    Mnuchin said he had met the economic adviser to Chinese
President Xi Jinping and had a ""very good and open dialogue"",
talking about North Korea sanctions and trade.
    ""We're working together on the issue of the trade deficit in
a mutual desire to shrink the trade deficit. We talked about
some very specific ideas that we both have on that."" 
    Asked about negotiations between the United States, Canada
and Mexico to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), Ross said it was more important to get a ""proper deal""
than a quick agreement.
    But he conceded that a Mexican presidential election,
Canadian provincial elections and the U.S. congressional
election -- all this year -- could complicate the talks if they
drag on.
    ""As we move further into the year, the political calendar
gets more complicated,"" Ross said.

    By Paritosh Bansal
    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Senior U.S. officials
hit back on Wednesday against suggestions that Donald Trump's
""America First"" agenda was hurting globalization and trade,
setting an aggressive tone ahead of the U.S. president's visit
to the World Economic Forum.
    World leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Brazilian President Michel
Temer, raised concerns this week at the gathering in the Swiss
ski resort of Davos about growing protectionism, in remarks that
delegates said seemed aimed at Trump’s policies. 
    German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Emmanuel Macron are also expected to speak later on Wednesday.
    Under his America First agenda, Trump has threatened to
withdraw from the North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA),
disavowed the global climate change accord and criticized global
institutions including the United Nations and NATO.
    Trump is expected to arrive by Thursday and deliver a
keynote address to the forum on Friday, mingling with the same
elite ""globalists"" that he bashed during his 2016 presidential
run. [nL2N1PI26D]
    In a press briefing in Davos ahead of his visit, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur
Ross defended aggressive trade actions taken by the United
States and said more were to come. 
    ""This is about an America First agenda. But America First
does mean working with the rest of the world,"" Mnuchin said. ""It
just means that President Trump is looking out for American
workers and American interests no different than he expects
other leaders would look out for their own.""
    Ross said U.S. trade actions were provoked by ""inappropriate
behaviour on the part of our trading counterparties."" 
    
    AMERICAN JOBS
    On Tuesday, for example, the United States slapped steep
import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, in moves
billed as a way to protect American jobs. China and South Korea
condemned the tariffs, with Seoul set to complain to the World
Trade Organization over the ""excessive"" move.
    ""Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade
but in fact actually practice extreme protectionism,"" Ross said.
    Many in Davos worry that a brighter world economic outlook
could darken if geopolitical threats - from protectionism and
climate change to cyber attacks and war - gather pace in 2018.
    Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to attend the forum
since Bill Clinton in 2000, is a source of much of this anxiety
after a volatile first year in office in which he has turned
American foreign policy on its head. [nL8N1PE4V6]
    The U.S. delegation is the largest ever to come to Davos,
with 10 members of the Trump's cabinet and senior White House
staff, Mnuchin said. That includes Jared Kushner, Trump's
son-in-law and adviser.
    When asked about a new agreement that is expected among 11
countries to forge an Asia-Pacific trade pact after the United
States pulled out of an earlier version, Mnuchin said the
Americans involvement was ""not off the table"". 
    But he added, ""We are fans of bilateral trading agreements.""
    Earlier on Tuesday, Canada's Trudeau called the new trade
agreement, expected to be signed in Chile in March, the ""right
deal"". 
    Ross said Trudeau’s comments needed to be taken in the
context of the latest round of talks on NAFTA. Perhaps there was
some inclination to use that to ""put pressure on the U.S. in the
NAFTA talks,"" Ross said.
    Mnuchin also said that he was not concerned in the short
term about a weak dollar, saying it is one of the most liquid
markets. 
   ""Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to
trade and opportunities,"" Mnuchin said.

    MONTREAL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S., Canadian and Mexican
negotiators opened a key week-long round of talks to modernize
NAFTA on Tuesday amid persistent concerns the Trump
administration is preparing to walk away from the trade deal, a
move that could roil financial markets.
    Time is running out for Canada and Mexico to address U.S.
demands for major changes to the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which President Donald Trump says has damaged the
American economy.
    Officials gathered in a Montreal hotel for the sixth and
penultimate round of talks, which are supposed to conclude by
the end of March to avoid a clash with Mexico's general
elections.
    Insiders say the Canadian and Mexican governments are
prepared to be flexible on a U.S. demand that the amount of
North American content in autos be boosted to qualify for
duty-free status in NAFTA.
    But Ottawa and Mexico City strongly oppose the proposal that
autos produced on the continent should have 50 percent U.S.
content. Differences also remain over how to address the U.S.
push for changes to various dispute resolution mechanisms.
    ""The Montreal round ... will be a high-noon moment I think 
for the agreement,"" said James Moore, a former Canadian minister
who is a member of a special council advising Canada's Foreign
Minister Chrystia Freeland on NAFTA.
    Canadian officials are downbeat about the talks amid
uncertainty over whether Washington really wants to negotiate or
plans to walk away.
    ""If you're unsure where the other side wants to go it is
really difficult to know what would please them unless you
capitulate, and that's not going to happen,"" one person briefed
on Ottawa's negotiating stance said on condition of anonymity.
    U.S. chief negotiator John Melle and Canadian chief
negotiator Steve Verheul declined to comment on Tuesday.

Time is running out for Canada and Mexico to address U.S. demands for major changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Donald Trump says has damaged the American economy. Officials gathered in a Montreal hotel for the sixth and penultimate round of talks, which are supposed to conclude by the end of March to avoid a clash with Mexico's general elections. Insiders say the Canadian and Mexican governments are prepared to be flexible on a U.S. demand that the amount of North American content in autos be boosted to qualify for duty-free status in NAFTA. But Ottawa and Mexico City strongly oppose the proposal that autos produced on the continent should have 50 percent U.S. content. Differences also remain over how to address the U.S. push for changes to various dispute resolution mechanisms. ""The Montreal round ... will be a high-noon moment I think for the agreement,"" said James Moore, a former Canadian minister who is a member of a special council advising Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on NAFTA. Canadian officials are downbeat about the talks amid uncertainty over whether Washington really wants to negotiate or plans to walk away. ""If you're unsure where the other side wants to go it is really difficult to know what would please them unless you capitulate, and that's not going to happen,"" one person briefed on Ottawa's negotiating stance said on condition of anonymity.

    The legislation would broaden the government's power to stop

Committee will hold a hearing on the topic on Thursday.

review, and potentially reject, smaller investments and add new
national security factors for CFIUS to consider. Those factors
include whether information about Americans, such as Social
Security numbers, would be exposed as part of the transaction or
whether the deal would facilitate fraud.
    CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech
deals involving China in particular and has blocked transactions
that involve sophisticated semiconductors.
    It has become more cautious since President Donald Trump was

    TOKYO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Eleven countries aiming to forge a
new Asia-Pacific trade pact after the United States pulled out
of an earlier version will hold a signing ceremony in Chile in
March, Japan's economy minister said on Tuesday in a big win for
Tokyo.
    Trade officials from the 11 countries had been meeting in
Tokyo to try to resolve rifts including Canada's insistence on
protection of its cultural industries such as movies, TV and
music.
    An agreement is a huge plus for Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe's government, which has been lobbying hard to save
the pact, originally called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. U.S.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the
original 12-nation trade agreement last year.
    Abe has painted the deal as a spur to growth and reform in
Japan and a symbol of commitment to free and multilateral trade
at a time when Trump is stressing ""America First"" policies.
    Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said that the new
agreement, known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement
for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP), or TPP-11, would be an
""engine to overcome protectionism"" emerging in parts of the
world.
    He also said Japan would explain the importance of the deal
to Washington in hopes of persuading it to join.
    Ministers from the 11 countries including Japan, Australia
and Canada had agreed in November on core elements to move ahead
without the United States, but demands by countries including
Canada for measures to ensure the deal protects jobs have been a
sticking point to finalising the agreement.
    Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also said last
week that the new agreement would leave a door open for eventual
U.S. participation.

    By Warren Strobel and Amanda Becker
    WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic lawmakers
criticized President Donald Trump on Tuesday for not immediately
imposing sanctions on Russia, accusing him of being soft on his
Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
    The Trump administration said on Monday it would not impose
sanctions for now under a law Congress overwhelmingly passed
last year to punish Moscow for meddling in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. Russia denies interfering in the
campaign. [nL2N1PO20G]
    As required by the law, the administration did publish a
list of Russian oligarchs close to the Kremlin who could be
sanctioned. Moscow dismissed it as little more than a ""telephone
directory"" of the rich. [nL8N1PP0MCA]. A U.S. Treasury
Department spokesman said on Tuesday the list was drawn from
public sources, including Forbes magazine.
    Putin said the release of the oligarchs list was ""an
unfriendly act"" that would harm Russian-American relations but
that Moscow did not currently plan to retaliate.  [nL8N1PP443]
    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Senate Banking
Committee on Tuesday that ""there will be sanctions that come out
of this (oligarch) report.""
    But two senior Democratic senators said the sanctions should
have come immediately.
    ""Throughout his term in office, President Trump has failed
time and time again to stand up to Vladimir Putin, despite the
assault that he carried out on our democracy in the 2016
election,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.
    ""Now he has decided not to implement those sanctions,""
Schumer told reporters. ""These are mandatory sanctions. They
passed 97-2 in the Senate. He's ignoring them.""
    Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said there was ""real concern"" about possible Russian
meddling in the 2018 U.S. elections, adding: ""The president of
the United States is not taking action to defend this nation."" 
    CIA Director Mike Pompeo said in an interview with the BBC
that aired on Tuesday that he expected Russia would target U.S.
congressional elections in November.
    Under the sanctions law, the administration faced a Monday
deadline to impose sanctions on anyone who was determined to
have conducted significant business with Russian defense and
intelligence sectors. Those sectors have already been sanctioned
for their alleged role in the U.S. presidential election.
    Trump, who wanted warmer ties with Moscow, had opposed the
legislation as it worked its way through Congress and signed it
reluctantly in August.
    State Department officials said they had used the law to
engage in a quiet, global effort to deter other countries from 
buying arms from Russian defense and intelligence entities.
    ""I assure you that the Russians know when a deal that they
thought was moving forward is all of a sudden falling apart and
not moving forward,"" a senior State Department official said.
    In a statement on Monday, State Department spokeswoman
Heather Nauert said, ""Since the enactment of the ...
legislation, we estimate that foreign governments have abandoned
planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in
Russian defense acquisitions.""
    
    'MISSED OPPORTUNITY'
    Daniel Fried, formerly the State Department's top sanctions
policy official, said: ""I think the administration missed an
opportunity to extend the use of sanctions"" to deter Russia.
    Fried, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, expressed
puzzlement at the list of Russian oligarchs, which he said
""seemed to be close to a cut-and-paste job.""
    He said he understood that experts within the U.S.
government had done their own extensive research on the
oligarchs closest to Putin. That information, he acknowledged,
could be in a classified version of the list.
    Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said he was heartened by a
classified briefing that the State Department gave on Monday to
the committee's staff.
    ""I am encouraged by the diplomatic steps Secretary (of State
Rex) Tillerson has taken in recent months to compel other
governments to comply with CAATSA,"" Corker said, using an
acronym for the Countering America's Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act. ""On the whole, it is clear the administration is
working in good faith.""

    FRANKFURT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - SMA Solar <S92G.DE>, Germany's
largest solar group, expects the industry to take a just a small
hit from import tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump
this week, sending its shares to an 11-week high.
    Trump on Monday approved a 30 percent tariff on solar cell
and module imports, dropping to 15 percent within four years. Up
to 2.5 gigawatts of unassembled solar cells can be imported
tariff-free in each year. [nL2N1PH1WV]
    Although the move was intended to help American
manufacturers, some in the sector said it could slow U.S.
investment in solar power and cost thousands of U.S. jobs.
[nL4N1PI2DF]
    However, SMA Solar, the world's largest maker of solar
inverters, said it expected the impact to be small, forecasting
industry growth in the Americas region would average about 18
percent per year until 2020, more than the 10 percent expected
globally.
    An inverter converts the output of a panel into current that
can be fed into a commercial electrical grid.
    ""SMA's market outlook includes a slightly negative impact
from the import tariff,"" SMA said on slides published during its
capital market day, giving no further details on the impact.
    The U.S. government argued that its domestic manufacturers
could not compete with what it said were artificially
lower-priced Asian solar panels.
    Shares in SMA Solar, which generated 46 percent of its sales
in the Americas in 2016, were up 4 percent by 1000 GMT, having
touched their highest level since Nov. 8. They had slipped after
news of the tariff plan this week.
    The company also this week reported preliminary 2017 results
and predicted growing sales this year. [nL8N1PJ1PV]

Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines
and solar panels on Monday, marking his first moves to erect
trade restrictions under seldom-used trade laws that allow
unilateral actions.
    The decisions in the two ""Section 201"" safeguard cases
followed findings by the U.S. International Trade Commission
that both imported products ""are a substantial cause of serious
injury to domestic manufacturers,"" U.S. Trade Representative
Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.
    The washer tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations
from ITC members, while the solar tariffs were lower than
domestic producers had hoped for.
    Trump will impose a 20 percent tariff on the first 1.2
million imported large residential washers in the first year,
and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that number. The
tariffs decline to 16 percent and 40 percent respectively in the
third year.
    A 30 percent tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells
and modules in the first year, with the tariffs declining to 15
percent by the fourth year. The tariff allows 2.5 gigawatts of
unassembled solar cells to be imported tariff-free in each year.
    Whirlpool Corp <WHR.N>, which brought the washers
""safeguard"" case against rivals Samsung Electronics <005930.KS>
and LG Electronics <066570.KS> after years of anti-dumping
cases, stands to benefit from the decision.
    ""This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and
will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South
Carolina and Tennessee,"" Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig said in
a statement. ""By enforcing our existing trade laws, President
Trump has ensured American workers will compete on a level
playing field with their foreign counterparts.""
    The move punishes Samsung, which recently began washer
production in South Carolina, and LG, which is building a washer
factory in Tennessee.
    LG said in a statement that the decision hindered the
ramp-up and employment prospects of its new plant, which will
not begin production until later 2018 or early 2019. Sears
Holdings' <SHLD.O> Kenmore brand sources its washers from LG
factories in South Korea.
    ""We are very disappointed in this misguided decision, which
far exceeds what the (ITC) recommended,"" LG said. ""This is a
textbook case about how certain companies can game the process
to use trade laws to try to accomplish what they can’t
accomplish in the marketplace.""
    
    FIRST OF SEVERAL POTENTIAL ACTIONS
    The decisions were the first of several potential tariff
actions that Trump may take in the coming weeks and months. He
is considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel
and aluminum on national security grounds under a 1962 trade law
and tariffs or other trade sanctions against China over its
intellectual property practices.
    The intellectual property, washer and solar panel probes
were done under a 1974 trade law that has been seldom invoked
since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995.
    The domestic solar panel producers who sought the trade
remedies wanted tariffs of 50 percent - the highest allowed
under law. Petitioners Suniva and SolarWorld <SWVKk.F> have said
they cannot compete with the influx of cheap imports, mostly
from China.
    Solar panel prices have dropped more than 30 percent since
early 2016, benefiting buyers but harming producers across the
globe.
    The U.S. solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries
Association, campaigned against the tariffs and estimated the
decision would effectively cause the loss of 23,000 U.S. jobs
this year and result in the delay or cancellation of billions of
dollars in solar investments.
    ""While tariffs in this case will not create adequate cell or
module manufacturing to meet U.S. demand, or keep foreign-owned
Suniva and SolarWorld afloat, they will create a crisis in a
part of our economy that has been thriving, which will
ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar
Americans their jobs,"" said SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper.
    Suniva, majority-owned by Hong Kong-listed Shunfeng
International Clean Energy Ltd <1169.HK>, applauded the
decision, saying: ""Over the last 5 years, nearly 30 American
solar manufacturers collapsed. Today the President is sending a
message that American innovation and manufacturing will not be
bullied out of existence without a fight.""

Chile foreign ministers, context on Latin America trade with
China)
    By Fabian Cambero and Dave Sherwood 
    SANTIAGO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China invited Latin American
and Caribbean countries to join its ""One Belt, One Road""
initiative on Monday, as part of an agreement to deepen economic
and political cooperation in a region where U.S. influence is
historically strong. 
    Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the region was a
natural fit for the initiative, which China has leveraged to
deepen economic and financial cooperation with developing
nations.
    ""China will always stay committed to the path of peaceful
development and the win-win strategy of opening up and stands
ready to share development dividends with all countries,"" Wang
said at a meeting between China and 33 members of the Community
of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).
    Representatives from China and CELAC signed a broad
agreement to expand ties in the second time China has met with
CELAC - a bloc formed in Venezuela in 2011 that does not include
the United States or Canada.
    Though it had few specific details, the agreement is part of
an evolving and more aggressive Chinese foreign policy in Latin
America as the United States, under President Donald Trump, has
taken a more protectionist stance.
    The ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, proposed in 2013 by
Chinese President Xi Jinping, promotes expanding links between
Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars in
infrastructure investment.
    Wang emphasized projects to improve connectivity between
land and sea, and cited the need to jointly build ""logistic,
electricity and information pathways."" 
    The so-called Santiago declaration, signed by China and
CELAC delegates, also calls for bolstering trade and taking
action on climate change. 
    Chile Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz, who has criticized
Trump in the past, said the agreement marked an ""historic"" new
era of dialogue between the region and China.
    ""China said something that is very important, that it wants
to be our must trustworthy partner in Latin America and the
Caribbean and we greatly value that,"" said Munoz. ""This meeting
represents a categoric repudiation of protectionism and
unilateralism.""
    China has sought a bigger role overseas since Trump was
elected, presenting its Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership trade agreement as an alternative to the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States has
abandoned.
    The country is already testing U.S. dominance in Latin
America, offering the region $250 billion in investment over the
next decade. It is the top trading partner of many countries in
the region, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
    Still, Wang played down the idea of a race for influence. 
    ""It has nothing to do with geopolitical competition. It
follows the principle of achieving shared growth through
discussion and collaboration,"" Wang said in his remarks. ""It is
nothing like a zero sum game.""
    In recent years, Chinese companies have moved away from
merely buying Latin American raw materials and are diversifying
into sectors such as auto manufacturing, e-commerce and even
technology businesses such as car-hailing services. 
    “Our relations with China are very broad, this (CELAC) is
one more pathway for Brazil to work with China. Together we
identified more areas of cooperation,” said Brazil's Vice
Foreign Minister Marcos Galvao.

the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by a Friday deadline.
    If he did so, the official said, the move would likely be
accompanied by new, targeted sanctions on Iranian businesses and

    Jan 25 (Reuters) - SunPower Corp <SPWR.O> on Thursday said
it was putting a $20 million U.S. factory expansion and hundreds
of new jobs on hold until and unless its solar panels receive an
exclusion from federal tariffs the Trump administration imposed
this week.
    President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on cheap
imported panels was intended to protect American manufacturing
jobs, but many in the solar industry have argued that tariffs
will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs in the
installation end of the industry. 
    SunPower, which is based in San Jose, California, but does
most of its manufacturing in the Philippines and Mexico, will be
hit harder than most in the industry by the announced 30 percent
tariff on imported solar modules, Chief Executive Tom Werner
said in an interview.
    ""We make a different product that's higher efficiency and
that product costs more,"" Werner said. ""We pay a higher tariff
despite the fact that it's an American technology.""
    SunPower has argued that its premium-priced panels, which
are among the most efficient in the industry at transforming
sunlight into electricity, should receive an exemption from the
tariffs because their unique technology cannot be compared with
that of more conventional models, including those made by the
companies that sought the tariffs, Suniva and SolarWorld.
    The Trump administration did not announce any product
exemptions when it unveiled the tariffs. The U.S. Trade
Representative will announce the rules for requesting an
exclusion by Feb. 22. The tariffs will take effect Feb. 7.
    ""We have to stop the $20 million investment because the
tariffs start before we know if we're excluded,"" Werner said.
""It's not hypothetical. These were positions that we were
recruiting for that we are going to stop."" 
    That investment would create ""hundreds"" of jobs at SunPower
facilities in California and Texas, Werner said. They would
include jobs in research and development, manufacturing and
sales and would be focused on the company's next-generation cell
technology.
    SunPower's project development arm has already lost business
to rival First Solar Inc <FSLR.O>, which makes panels that are
exempt from tariffs.
    SunPower is majority owned by France's Total SA <TOTF.PA>.

    By Tom Miles
    GENEVA, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Canada has launched a
wide-ranging trade dispute against the United States,
challenging Washington's use of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
duties, Canada said in WTO filing dated Dec. 20 and published on
Wednesday.
    Canada appeared to be mounting a case on behalf of the rest
of the world, since it cited almost 200 examples of alleged U.S.
wrongdoing, almost all of them concerning other trading
partners, such as China, India, Brazil and the European Union.
    The 32-page complaint homed in on technical details of the
U.S. trade rulebook, ranging from the U.S. treatment of export
controls to the use of retroactive duties and split decisions by
the six-member U.S. International Trade Commission.
    Canada said U.S. procedures broke the WTO's Anti-Dumping
Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the
Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement
of Disputes.
    Anti-dumping and countervailing duties - punitive tariffs to
restrict imports that are unfairly priced or subsidised in order
to beat the competition - are a core component of Washington's
trade arsenal, and frequently used to defend U.S. interests. 
    Such tariffs are allowed under WTO rules but they are
subject to strict conditions. 
    The United States has been under fire for years about the
way it calculates unfair pricing, or dumping. It has already
lost a string of WTO disputes after its calculation methodology
was ruled to be out of line with the WTO rulebook.
    Under President Donald Trump, the United States has
threatened to expand the use of punitive duties against China
and has angered Beijing by refusing to accede to China's demand
to be treated as any other ""market economy"".
    Trump has also upset Canada by slapping punitive tariffs on
Canadian softwood lumber exports, leading to a challenge by
Ottawa at the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Canada appeared to be mounting a case on behalf of the rest of the world, since it cited almost 200 examples of alleged U.S. wrongdoing, almost all of them concerning other trading partners, such as China, India, Brazil and the European Union. The 32-page complaint homed in on technical details of the U.S. trade rulebook, ranging from the U.S. treatment of export controls to the use of retroactive duties and split decisions by the six-member U.S. International Trade Commission. Canada said U.S. procedures broke the WTO's Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties - punitive tariffs to restrict imports that are unfairly priced or subsidised in order to beat the competition - are a core component of Washington's trade arsenal, and frequently used to defend U.S. interests. Such tariffs are allowed under WTO rules but they are subject to strict conditions. The United States has been under fire for years about the way it calculates unfair pricing, or dumping. It has already lost a string of WTO disputes after its calculation methodology was ruled to be out of line with the WTO rulebook. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has threatened to expand the use of punitive duties against China and has angered Beijing by refusing to accede to China's demand to be treated as any other ""market economy"". Trump has also upset Canada by slapping punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber exports, leading to a challenge by Ottawa at the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement.",canada launch wideranging trade dispute unite state challenge washingtons use antidumping antisubsidy duties canada wto file date dec 20 publish wednesday canada appear mount case behalf rest world since cite almost 200 examples allege wrongdoing almost concern trade partner china india brazil european union 32page complaint home technical detail trade rulebook range treatment export control use retroactive duties split decisions sixmember international trade commission canada procedures break wtos antidumping agreement agreement subsidies countervail measure general agreement tariff trade understand rule procedures govern settlement dispute antidumping countervail duties punitive tariff restrict import unfairly price subsidise order beat competition core component washingtons trade arsenal frequently use defend interest tariff allow wto rule subject strict condition unite state fire years way calculate unfair price dump already lose string wto dispute calculation methodology rule line wto rulebook unite state threaten expand use punitive duties china anger beijing refuse accede chinas demand treat market economy also upset canada slap punitive tariff canadian softwood lumber export lead challenge ottawa wto north american free trade agreement

    DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The head of China's
second-biggest e-commerce company, JD.com Inc <JD.O>, accused
the United States on Wednesday of practising ""serious""
protectionism against Chinese firms and said this would
ultimately backfire on the world's largest economy.
    ""Many friends from other countries discuss protectionism in
China but I think things have completely reversed,"" JD.com
Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Liu said at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
    ""One day it will hurt the U.S. economy too,"" said Liu, whose
$67 billion online retailer competes with bigger rival Alibaba
Group Holding <BABA.N>.

    The U.S. government also recently rejected Chinese firm Ant
Financial's plan to acquire U.S. money transfer firm MoneyGram
International Inc <MGI.O> over national security concerns, the
most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the Trump
administration. [nL4N1OY24G]
    The U.S. government has toughened its stance on the sale of
American companies to Chinese entities, at a time of already
tense trade ties, with Washington vowing to narrow a large trade
deficit with China which reached $347 billion in 2016.
    Liu said Nasdaq-listed JD.com not only wants to overtake
Alibaba as the largest online retailer in China, but also become
a global player. But like other Chinese CEOs, he said he had
found it difficult to make forays into the U.S. market.
    For now, the company is focused on Southeast Asia, and would
look to grow in the region both organically and by acquisition.
    ""It's hard to use only one model. In Southeast Asia, we look
for local partners to develop business, but we don't want to
exclude acquisitions,"" Liu said.
    In January, JD.com said it had made an investment in
Vietnamese e-commerce firm Tiki.vn, the latest move in a
strategic push into the region where Alibaba and Amazon <AMZN.O>
 have also made significant investments in the past year.

    * Democrats say move will make healthcare harder to obtain

 (Recasts lead, adds reaction from Democrats, health advocacy
groups)
    By Yasmeen Abutaleb
    WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration told
U.S. states on Thursday they can for the first time move toward
imposing work or job training requirements on people as a
condition for obtaining health insurance under the Medicaid
government program for the poor.
    The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued
guidance making it easier for states to design and propose test
programs that implement such requirements. States must propose
such changes through waivers and receive federal approval.
    Democrats and health advocacy groups blasted the policy and
said it would make it more difficult for the most vulnerable
Americans to have access to healthcare services. 
    Medicaid, an important social safety net program created
five decades ago and expanded under Republican President Donald
Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, has never had such
conditions attached.
    Seema Verma, the agency's administrator, said the policy
guidance came in response to requests from at least 10 states
that had proposed requiring some Medicaid recipients to work or
participate in activities such as skills training, education,
job search, volunteering or caregiving. Those states, mostly
Republican led, include Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and
Wisconsin.
    Certain Medicaid recipients would be exempt from the rules,
including those with disabilities, the elderly, children and
pregnant women, the administration said. Verma also said states
would have to make ""reasonable modifications"" for those battling
opioid addiction and other substance-use disorders.
    ""This gives us a pathway to start approving waivers,"" Verma
said on a call with reporters. ""This is about helping those
individuals rise out of poverty.""
    Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature
domestic policy achievement commonly known as Obamacare, 31
states expanded Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of
the poverty level as defined by the federal government, adding
millions of people to the rolls. 
    Republicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace
Obamacare, a top Trump campaign promise. Instead, his
administration has sought to weaken the program through
executive orders and administrative rules. 
    Advocacy groups said most Medicaid recipients already have
jobs, and those who do not may have difficulty accessing
transportation to get to and from work or need to care for
family members.
    ""This action by the Trump administration goes after people
who are just trying to get by,"" said Democratic U.S. Senator Ron
Wyden of Oregon. ""Healthcare is a right that shouldn't be
contingent on the ideological agendas of politicians.""
    The federal government reimburses a portion of the money
spent by states to provide Medicaid coverage for those who are
eligible. Many Republicans opposed the enlargement of Medicaid
eligibility authorized under Obamacare. Many Republican-governed
states declined to take part in the expansion.
    The Obama administration opposed state efforts to implement
work requirements in Medicaid because it could result in fewer
people having health insurance. 
    For instance, Kentucky last year proposed work requirements
for able-bodied adults to get Medicaid insurance as well as new
fees for all members based on income. A study found the proposal
would reduce the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly
86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.
    Republicans argue that Medicaid was created to serve the
most vulnerable and has become bloated under Obamacare. Verma
and other Republicans said implementing work and community
engagement requirements could help improve health outcomes by
connecting people with jobs and training.

    MONTREAL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Canadian negotiators at the
NAFTA talks will unveil on Wednesday ideas to address U.S.
demands for higher North American content in autos, a
contentious issue that is threatening the effort to modernize
the 1994 trade deal, three well-placed sources said.
    The sixth and penultimate round of negotiations to update
the North American Free Trade Agreement opened in Montreal on
Tuesday as time runs out for Canada and Mexico to settle big
differences with the United States.
    With financial markets skittish about the possible collapse
of a $1.2 trillion global trading bloc, Canada and Mexico say
they are prepared to be flexible on U.S. proposals they had
initially rejected as unworkable. 
    At a meeting of chief negotiators on Wednesday, Canada's
Steve Verheul will suggest ways to accommodate Washington's
insistence that auto content in North American vehicles be
lifted, said a source with knowledge of the talks.
    Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the net cost of a
passenger car or light truck must originate in the United
States, Canada or Mexico to avoid tariffs. U.S. President Donald
Trump's administration wants the threshold raised to 85 percent.
    Trump has described NAFTA as disastrous for the U.S. economy
and threatened to pull out of the pact, though on Tuesday he
said the talks in Montreal were going well.
    Canada is floating the idea that North American content in
autos would be higher if the value of software and other
high-tech equipment made on the continent were taken into
account, said the sources, who declined to be identified given
the sensitivity of the situation.
    Existing NAFTA rules for tracing auto parts in a vehicle do
not take into account new software-based content produced in
Canada and the United States.
    ""There's real hope from Canada that the Americans will
appreciate that these concepts are designed to help them achieve
their goals on local content,"" one of the sources said.
    
    GENERATE TRACTION
    A trade group representing U.S. auto parts makers on Monday
urged the Trump administration to adopt NAFTA auto rules that
cover research, engineering, design and software development
work as part of North American regional value content
goals.[nL2N1PH21K]
    A third source said Mexico had no intention of making formal
proposals on autos. All three sources said Canada and Mexico
would reject the demand for 50 percent U.S. content in autos on
the grounds that it would not work.
    Verheul said on Tuesday he would be ""bringing new ideas on
the autos rule of origin issue"" while making clear the
conversation would be informal.
    ""We don't see a lot of value in making ... a formal
counter-proposal right now,"" he told reporters. ""We think we
need to take a step back, talk about ideas, generate some
traction with some ideas and move in that direction.""
    His remarks indicated negotiators could struggle to meet the
end-of-March deadline for concluding the talks, since Canada's
more relaxed approach would leave precious little time for a
formal discussion once and if it outlined its stance.
    Whether the process has any chance of wrapping up by that
deadline is unclear. Negotiators do not want the talks to clash
with the Mexican general elections in July.
    U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday said
""there's a good chance"" the talks would be successful.
    The Trump administration, however, has sent out so many
conflicting messages about NAFTA that Canadian officials say
they are taking nothing for granted.
    Ontario Farmer magazine on Tuesday quoted Verheul as telling
dairy industry officials last week that settling NAFTA in the
short term was ""probably the least likely"" outcome. Canadian
officials were not immediately available when asked whether he
had been accurately quoted.

    SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - South Korea said on Tuesday the
government will complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
about a U.S. decision to slap tariffs on imported washing
machines and solar panels, calling the action ""excessive"" and
""regrettable"". 
    ""The United States has opted for measures that put political
considerations ahead of international standards,"" South Korea's
trade minister Kim Hyun-chong said in a meeting with industry
officials on Tuesday.
    ""The government will actively respond to the spread of
protectionist measures to defend national interests,"" he said.
    U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on
imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday, dealing a
blow to South Korea's Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> and LG
Electronics <066570.KS>
    The decisions in the two ""Section 201"" safeguard cases came
after the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) found that
both imported products  were ""a substantial cause of serious
injury to domestic manufacturers.""
    The tariffs being imposed on washing machines exceeded the
harshest recommendations from ITC members, while the solar
tariffs were lower than domestic producers had hoped for.  
    Trump ignored a recommendation from the ITC to exclude South
Korean-produced washing machines from LG from the tariffs.
    The United States will impose a 20 percent tariff on the
first 1.2 million imported large residential washers in the
first year, and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that
number. The tariffs decline to 16 percent and 40 percent
respectively in the third year.
    A 30 percent tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells
and modules in the first year, with the tariffs declining to 15
percent by the fourth year. The tariff allows 2.5 gigawatts of
unassembled solar cells to be imported tariff-free in each year.
    ""The latest safeguard measures are in violation to WTO
rules,"" Kim said.  
    LG Electronics shares fell as much as 5 percent in Seoul
trading but recovered to stand just 1.8 percent lower than
Monday's close, while shares in Samsung Electronics were up 0.83
percent in line with the South Korean market's <.KS11> 0.9
percent gain.

The United States will impose a 20 percent tariff on the first 1.2 million imported large residential washers in the first year, and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that number. The tariffs decline to 16 percent and 40 percent respectively in the third year. A 30 percent tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells and modules in the first year, with the tariffs declining to 15 percent by the fourth year. The tariff allows 2.5 gigawatts of unassembled solar cells to be imported tariff-free in each year. ""The latest safeguard measures are in violation to WTO rules,"" Kim said.

    GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Taiwan has joined South Korea in
demanding compensation for steep U.S. tariffs on solar panels,
opening a 30-day window for negotiations, a World Trade
Organization filing showed on Tuesday. [nL8N1PK2XB]
    Last week U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a 30
percent tariff on imported solar panels, billed as a way to
protect American jobs but which the solar industry said would
lead to layoffs and raise consumer prices. [nL2N1PI25M]
    It was among the first unilateral trade restrictions imposed
by the administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda
that has alarmed Asian trading partners producing cheaper goods.
    Taiwan, with no fossil fuel resources but a booming tech
sector, says it ranks as the world's second largest solar cell
manufacturing base after China, putting it at the heart of an
industry caught up in a global trade battle.
    The United States, India and China are all racing to develop
their solar industry, a huge growth area as the world moves
towards environmentally friendly sources of energy, and are
engaged in legal fights to keep their firms in pole position.
    The United States has alleged that China and India are
giving their solar sectors an illicit leg-up, and last week
Trump resorted to ""safeguard"" tariffs, effectively shielding
U.S. solar manufacturers from foreign competition. 
    Safeguard tariffs are allowed under WTO rules to protect a
particular sector from a sudden, unforeseen and damaging surge
in imports. 
    But the WTO's Agreement on Safeguards says any country
imposing safeguard tariffs must ""endeavour to maintain a
substantially equivalent level of concessions and other
obligations"".
    In other words, the United States is expected to balance its
solar restrictions by letting suppliers such as Taiwan impose
restrictions of equal value on U.S. exports. 
    If there is no agreement, Taiwan can put unilateral
sanctions on U.S. trade - but, according to the WTO rules, not
for three years, giving Washington a substantial period in which
it can protect its solar industry for free. 
    The WTO has no record of a negotiated safeguards settlement,
and safeguard tariffs are often contentious, producing 47 formal
disputes in the WTO's 23-year history.

aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the

    WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The number of Americans
without healthcare insurance rose by 3.2 million people between
2016 and 2017, or 1.3 percentage points to 12.2 percent,
according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday, the biggest jump
in the uninsured rate in nearly a decade. 
    Several factors likely contributed to the jump, Gallup said,
including attempts by Republicans, who control both chambers of
Congress and the White House, to repeal and replace the 2010
Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. The law extended
health insurance to 20 million Americans.
    Republicans have so far failed to make good on President
Donald Trump's campaign promise to end Obamacare, but they
repealed the so-called individual mandate, or requirement that
most Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine, in
a tax bill that passed in December.
   The jump in uninsured followed a consistent decline between
2014 and 2016, the time period when much of Obamacare was being
implemented, after peaking at 18 percent in 2013, Gallup said.
With the repeal of the individual mandate and insurance premiums
that are likely to continue rising, the uninsured rate will
likely increase further in coming years, the pollster said.
    The Trump administration has said it was wrong to force
Americans to sign up for healthcare, as Obamacare did. It did
not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    The uninsured rate rose among all demographic groups in
2017, except those 65 and older, who qualify for Medicare, the
government health insurance program for the elderly. But young
adults, blacks, Hispanics and low-income Americans saw the
biggest rise in the uninsured rate, Gallup found. Young and
healthy consumers, in particular, are needed to help offset the
costs of older, sicker and more expensive patients.
    The overall jump in uninsured was the biggest since Gallup
began the poll in 2008.
    Gallup said media coverage of repeated attempts to repeal
and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obama's signature
domestic policy achievement, may have caused confusion among
consumers. It also pointed to health insurers who pulled out of
the Obamacare individual market due to uncertainty, leaving
consumers with fewer and more expensive choices, which may have
prompted some to forego coverage. 
    Trump administration decisions to slash the Obamacare
advertising budget by 90 percent and cut the sign-up period in
half also likely played a role in the rise of uninsured
Americans, Gallup said.

threatens the global trade system,  China's foreign ministry
said on Monday, after U.S. President Donald Trump's
administration called U.S. support for Beijing's joining the
World Trade Organization in 2001 a mistake.
    WTO rules have proved ineffective in making China embrace a
market-oriented trade regime, and the United States ""erred"" in
backing China's entry to the trade body on such terms, the
office of the U.S. Trade Representative said last week.
[nL1N1PE227]
    Its report came as Trump weighs a series of trade actions
against Beijing, including a decision in a ""Section 301""
investigation into China's alleged theft of intellectual
property, expected in the next few weeks.
    Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that since
China joined the WTO, it had strictly followed the body's rules,
carried out its obligations and contributed to the development
of the multilateral system.
    Other countries have benefited from trade with China, which
has stuck by the route of reform and opening up and has
supported an open global economy, she added. 
    ""I think everyone has seen that it's precisely the United
States' unilateralist methods, and the sounds it's made on
unilateralism, that are an unprecedented challenge to the
multilateral trade system,"" Hua told a regular news briefing.
    ""Many WTO members have already expressed worry about this,""
she added.
    ""So we hope the United States can correctly view China and
at the same time take their own actual steps to protect the
multilateral trading system.""
    China has sought to portray itself as a champion of global
trade in the face of Trump's ""America First"" policies, despite
criticism from foreign businesses, and their governments, that
many parts of its market are protected from foreign competition.
    Critics also say Chinese industrial policies seek to
assimilate and supplant foreign technology.   
    White House officials have said China has failed to follow
through on promises to move toward a market-oriented economy.
    Trump told Reuters in an interview last week that he was
considering a big ""fine"" against China for forcing U.S.
companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a
cost of doing business there. [nL1N1PD00B] 
    In Beijing, many experts believe Washington is unwilling to
pay the heavy economic price needed to upset prevailing trade
dynamics between the two countries, including China's record
high trade surplus of $275.81 billion with the United States in
2017. [nB9N1OT022]

Its report came as Trump weighs a series of trade actions against Beijing, including a decision in a ""Section 301"" investigation into China's alleged theft of intellectual property, expected in the next few weeks. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that since China joined the WTO, it had strictly followed the body's rules, carried out its obligations and contributed to the development of the multilateral system. Other countries have benefited from trade with China, which has stuck by the route of reform and opening up and has supported an open global economy, she added. ""I think everyone has seen that it's precisely the United States' unilateralist methods, and the sounds it's made on unilateralism, that are an unprecedented challenge to the multilateral trade system,"" Hua told a regular news briefing. ""Many WTO members have already expressed worry about this,"" she added. ""So we hope the United States can correctly view China and at the same time take their own actual steps to protect the multilateral trading system."" China has sought to portray itself as a champion of global trade in the face of Trump's ""America First"" policies, despite criticism from foreign businesses, and their governments, that many parts of its market are protected from foreign competition. Critics also say Chinese industrial policies seek to assimilate and supplant foreign technology. White House officials have said China has failed to follow through on promises to move toward a market-oriented economy. Trump told Reuters in an interview last week that he was considering a big ""fine"" against China for forcing U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there. In Beijing, many experts believe Washington is unwilling to pay the heavy economic price needed to upset prevailing trade dynamics between the two countries, including China's record high trade surplus of $275.81 billion with the United States in 2017.",unite state china threaten global trade system chinas foreign ministry monday administration call support beijings join world trade organization 2001 mistake wto rule prove ineffective make china embrace marketoriented trade regime unite state err back chinas entry trade body term office trade representative last week report come weigh series trade action beijing include decision section 301 investigation chinas allege theft intellectual property expect next weeks foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying since china join wto strictly follow body rule carry obligations contribute development multilateral system countries benefit trade china stick route reform open support open global economy add think everyone see precisely unite state unilateralist methods sound make unilateralism unprecedented challenge multilateral trade system hua tell regular news brief many wto members already express worry add hope unite state correctly view china time take actual step protect multilateral trade system china seek portray champion global trade face america first policies despite criticism foreign businesses governments many part market protect foreign competition critics also chinese industrial policies seek assimilate supplant foreign technology white house officials china fail follow promise move toward marketoriented economy tell reuters interview last week consider big fine china force company transfer intellectual property china cost business beijing many experts believe washington unwilling pay heavy economic price need upset prevail trade dynamics two countries include chinas record high trade surplus 27581 billion unite state 2017

    The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap widened

    XIAN, China, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Never let is be said
diplomacy amounts to more than horse-trading.
    French President Emmanuel Macron went out of his way to win
the heart of the Chinese leader on the first day of his state
visit on Monday, offering him a horse of the elite French
Republican Guard.
    Macron is on a three-day tour of China starting with a stop
in Xian, an eastern departure point of the ancient Silk Road
where he visited the Terracotta Army with his wife Brigitte and
will talk of past and future Sino-French relations.
    An adept of soft diplomacy and symbols, Macron picked an
8-year old brown gelding named Vesuvius from the presidential
cavalry corps and braved stringent Chinese quarantine checks to
offer it to President Xi Jinping.
    The choice of the gift, an ""unprecedented diplomatic
gesture"" according to the French presidency, was made after the
Chinese president expressed his fascination for the 104 horsemen
who escorted him during his last visit to Paris in 2014.
    It is the first time France has offered one of the elite
cavalry corps' horses and is also a response to China's ""panda
diplomacy"", after Macron's wife Brigitte became the godmother of
a Chinese panda lent by Beijing to a zoo near Paris.
    ""It mattered a lot for the president, even if it was very
complicated to import a horse for sanitary reasons. It's a
symbol of French excellence,"" an Elysee official said.
    Since his election last May, France's youngest leader since
Napoleon has shown his willingness to use symbols and history to
win over his global counterparts.
    Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin in May
with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of France's former
monarchy, built in Versailles by Louis XIV - the ""Sun King"" - to
symbolise absolute power. 
    He also invited U.S. President Donald Trump to watch a
military parade on the grandest avenue of Paris on Bastille Day
last July to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry
into World War One. 
    Trump later said Macron was doing a ""terrific job"".
    In Xian, Macron decided at the last minute to visit the Wild
Goose Pagoda, a virtually unknown landmark in the West compared
with the terracotta soldiers but well-known by Chinese people as
a historic site for Buddhism.
    The 40-year old French president is keen to gain more access
for French companies to often protected Chinese markets and is
travelling with a delegation of about 50 businessmen.

details)
    By David Ljunggren and Anthony Esposito
    MONTREAL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Canadian negotiators at the
NAFTA talks will unveil on Wednesday ideas to address U.S.
demands for higher North American content in autos, a
contentious issue that is threatening the effort to modernize
the 1994 trade deal, three well-placed sources said.
    The sixth and penultimate round of negotiations to update
the North American Free Trade Agreement opened in Montreal on
Tuesday with time running out for Canada and Mexico to settle
big differences with the United States.
    With financial markets skittish about the possible collapse
of a $1.2 trillion global trading bloc, Canada and Mexico say
they are prepared to be flexible on U.S. proposals they had
initially rejected as unworkable. 
    They also are looking for ways to deal with a U.S. demand
for a sunset clause that would kill NAFTA if it is not
renegotiated after five years, an idea critics say would slash
business investment.
    Canada's chief negotiator Steve Verheul told Reuters he had
""a constructive conversation"" with his U.S. counterpart on
Wednesday after presenting Canada's suggested amendments to the
sunset clause. He did not give details.
    A source close to the talks said Canada's approach mirrored
Mexico's proposal last year for a semi-regular review of the
treaty that would not lead to its termination.
    Verheul said he would raise the auto content issue later in
the day with his counterparts.
    Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the net cost of a
passenger car or light truck must originate in the United
States, Canada or Mexico to avoid tariffs. U.S. President Donald
Trump's administration wants the threshold raised to 85 percent.
    Trump has described NAFTA as disastrous for the U.S. economy
and threatened to pull out of the pact, though on Tuesday he
said the talks in Montreal were going well.
    Canada is floating the idea that North American content in
autos would be higher if the value of software and other
high-tech equipment made on the continent were taken into
account, said the sources, who declined to be identified given
the sensitivity of the situation.
    Existing NAFTA rules for tracing auto parts in a vehicle do
not take into account new software-based content produced in
Canada and the United States.
    ""There's real hope from Canada that the Americans will
appreciate that these concepts are designed to help them achieve
their goals on local content,"" one of the sources said.
    
    GENERATE TRACTION
    A trade group representing U.S. auto parts makers on Monday
urged the Trump administration to adopt NAFTA auto rules that
cover research, engineering, design and software development
work as part of North American regional value content
goals.[nL2N1PH21K]
    A third source said Mexico had no intention of making formal
proposals on autos. All three sources said Canada and Mexico
would reject the demand for 50 percent U.S. content in autos on
the grounds that it would not work.
    Verheul said on Tuesday he did not see much sense in making
a formal counter-proposal on autos.
    His remarks indicated negotiators could struggle to meet the
end-of-March deadline for concluding the talks, since Canada's
more relaxed approach would leave precious little time for a
formal discussion once it outlined its stance.
    Whether the process has any chance of wrapping up by that
deadline is unclear. Negotiators do not want the talks to clash
with the Mexican general elections in July.
    U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday said
""there's a good chance"" the talks would be successful.
    The Trump administration, however, has sent out so many
conflicting messages about NAFTA that Canadian officials say
they are taking nothing for granted.
    Ontario Farmer magazine on Tuesday quoted Verheul as telling
dairy industry officials last week that settling NAFTA in the
short term was ""probably the least likely"" outcome. A
spokeswoman at the Dairy Farmers of Canada confirmed Verheul had
been accurately quoted.

    OTTAWA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian government is sending
three cabinet ministers to the United States to stress the
merits of NAFTA, officials said on Thursday, paving the way for
key talks that could either sink or save the trade pact.
    Canada and Mexico object to major changes that Washington
wants to make to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and
time is running out to settle differences before the
negotiations are scheduled to wrap up at the end of March.
    Officials will hold the sixth and penultimate round of talks
in Montreal from Jan. 23-28. 
    One cabinet minister is already in the United States and two
more will travel this weekend.
    Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the
United States, has been reaching out to U.S. politicians and the
business community for almost two years to bolster support for
free trade. [nL1N1JP21B]
    ""We recognize we are heading into an important period. We
are certainly preparing for all scenarios, and we're hopeful
that we can make progress,"" a spokesman for Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland said when asked about the latest visits.
    ""That's what we're focused on achieving, including in
Montreal,"" Alex Lawrence, the spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.
    Separate news releases announcing the ministerial trips make
clear the cabinet members have been instructed to ""promote trade
and NAFTA.""
    Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale wraps up a two-day trip
to Kentucky on Friday while Agriculture Minister Lawrence
MacAulay is due to visit Tennessee over the weekend. At the same
time, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna will be in San
Francisco. 
    Canadian officials are increasingly pessimistic about the
prospects for the 1994 trade treaty, which U.S. President Donald
Trump blames for the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S.
manufacturing jobs and a big trade deficit with Mexico.
    In a low-level meeting held in Washington last month between
the fifth and sixth rounds, negotiators made some progress on
less controversial issues but left untouched the thorniest
subjects of the sourcing of auto parts, dispute settlement and
an expiry clause. [nL1N1OF1VE]
    Trade experts predict that unless Canada and Mexico make
some concessions in Montreal, Trump will be more tempted to
issue a notice of withdrawal from NAFTA, as he has repeatedly
threatened if U.S. demands for change cannot be met.

    SANTIAGO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chile's foreign minister
welcomed Chinese representatives to a meeting with Latin
American and Caribbean countries on Sunday, praising the Asian
nation for rejecting protectionism as the United States backs
away from global trade.
    Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz, who has criticized U.S.
President Donald Trump in the past, told a news conference that
Latin America could do a lot more to stimulate trade with China
and called on its nations to take advantage of the talks to
improve ties.    
    ""We are in uncertain and complex times, and China is playing
a very constructive role in addressing these complexities,"" he
said.
    China has sought a bigger role overseas since Trump was
elected, presenting its Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership trade agreement as an alternative to the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was abandoned by the United
States.
    Representatives from China and the 33 members of the
Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) are
holding meetings on Sunday and Monday in the Chilean capital,
Santiago.
    China sees it as ""natural"" to expand its westward
infrastructure drive - the ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative - to
Latin America, China's foreign minister said in an interview
with a local newspaper on Sunday.
    ""China wants the participation of all the countries of the
region to be involved in the construction of the 'One Belt, One
Road' ... so they can share the great opportunities and
dividends of this platform of global cooperation,"" Minister Wang
Yi said in an interview with El Mercurio. 
    Proposed in 2013 by President Xi Jinping, the project
promotes a vision of expanding links between Asia, Africa and
Europe, with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
    China is already testing U.S. dominance in Latin America,
offering the region $250 billion in investment over the next
decade. It is the top trading partner of many countries in the
region, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
    In recent years, Chinese companies have moved away from
merely buying Latin American raw materials and are diversifying
into sectors like auto manufacturing, e-commerce and even
technology businesses like car-hailing services.  
    Chile, one of the most open economies in Latin America,
updated its bilateral trade deal with China in November 2017 on
the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic summit.
    ""Like Chile, China rejects protectionism in favor of
openness, connectivity, investment, trade and cooperation,""
Munoz said.

plans to raise safeguard issues during talks with the United
States to revise a bilateral trade deal following Washington's
decision to slap steep tariffs on imported washing machines and
solar panels. 
    Experts say safeguard issues could toughen the outlook for
the talks, which could risk alienating Seoul and Washington in
the face of North Korea's nuclear threat.  
    ""Trade remedies are an important issue to us. We plan to
bring up the issue,"" said Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea's deputy
minister for free trade agreement negotiations, referring to
safeguard issues.
    ""We will put the utmost priority on national interests
during negotiations,"" she told reporters ahead of the second
round of talks that began in Seoul on Wednesday. 
    She said autos and an investor-state dispute mechanism were
also expected to be put on the table, without elaborating.    
    Seoul said it would complain to the World Trade Organization
after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on
imported washing machines and solar panels earlier this month,
describing the move as ""excessive"". [nL2N1PH1WV]
    The safeguard issue, a sensitive area for Washington, would
""complicate"" the outlook for the bilateral talks, said Wendy
Cutler, a former chief negotiator on the bilateral deal that was
first signed in 2007.
    She said Seoul pushed hard during the original talks to
address anti-dumping and safeguard issues but did not succeed.
    ""My advice would be you're not going to succeed in that
area. I think the same way Korea does not want to discuss
agriculture, the U.S. is not going to discuss trade remedies,""
Cutler told Reuters.
    She said the priority for U.S. President Donald Trump's
administration was to use trade remedy laws to act against
countries that are dumping or subsidising the imports they are
selling in the United States.   
    Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Michael Beeman, who is
representing the U.S. during the trade talks, did not answer
questions from Reuters.
    The talks to revise the almost 6-year-old trade deal started
in Washington earlier this month after Trump threatened to scrap
the ""horrible"" deal that has increased the U.S. trade deficit
with South Korea. The second round will continue on Thursday. 
    The United States wants to give U.S. automakers better
access to the South Korea market while maintaining its high
tariffs on pickup truck imports from South Korea, sources have
said.

Experts say safeguard issues could toughen the outlook for the talks, which could risk alienating Seoul and Washington in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat. ""Trade remedies are an important issue to us. We plan to bring up the issue,"" said Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea's deputy minister for free trade agreement negotiations, referring to safeguard issues. ""We will put the utmost priority on national interests during negotiations,"" she told reporters ahead of the second round of talks that began in Seoul on Wednesday. She said autos and an investor-state dispute mechanism were also expected to be put on the table, without elaborating. Seoul said it would complain to the World Trade Organization after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels earlier this month, describing the move as ""excessive"". The safeguard issue, a sensitive area for Washington, would ""complicate"" the outlook for the bilateral talks, said Wendy Cutler, a former chief negotiator on the bilateral deal that was first signed in 2007. She said Seoul pushed hard during the original talks to address anti-dumping and safeguard issues but did not succeed. ""My advice would be you're not going to succeed in that area. I think the same way Korea does not want to discuss agriculture, the U.S. is not going to discuss trade remedies,"" Cutler told Reuters. She said the priority for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was to use trade remedy laws to act against countries that are dumping or subsidising the imports they are selling in the United States. Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Michael Beeman, who is representing the U.S. during the trade talks, did not answer questions from Reuters. The talks to revise the almost 6-year-old trade deal started in Washington earlier this month after Trump threatened to scrap the ""horrible"" deal that has increased the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. The second round will continue on Thursday.

    MONTREAL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Auto industry officials
fretting about hardline U.S. NAFTA demands with the potential to
turn a globally integrated industry upside down now are hopeful
that a Canadian compromise plan could avert disaster.
    The officials, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of NAFTA
talks here, said strenuous lobbying efforts on behalf of the
industry were starting to sink in with some key members of the
Trump administration.
    Automakers and their suppliers are worried that the U.S.
demands will cause the 24-year-old North American Free Trade
Agreement to collapse, or render its tariff-free benefits
unusable. Either outcome would wreak havoc on supply chains that
have auto parts and vehicles regularly crisscrossing North
American borders 
    Industry trade groups have estimated that a full reversion
to World Trade Organization tariff levels would cost the
industry some $10 billion a year and cause the loss of up to
50,000 U.S. auto parts jobs.   
    The Trump administration, which blames NAFTA for killing off
U.S. manufacturing jobs, wants the requirement for the value
content, or net cost, of autos sourced from the three NAFTA
countries boosted to 85 percent from 62.5 percent for
tariff-free trade.
    It also insists that 50 percent of the content of every
vehicle produced in the region come from the United States, an
option that Canada and Mexico have dismissed as unworkable.
    In a bid to keep the talks alive Canada is now suggesting
that North American content in autos - known as rules of origin
- should be calculated to also include the value of software,
engineering and other high-value work, which currently is not
counted toward the regional content targets  [nL2N1PJ1O8]
    The plan got a boost from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles
<FCHA.MI> Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne on Thursday, who
called it a ""defensible"" concept and a ""step in the right
direction.""
    ""Within the structure proposed by the Canadians, there
appears to be the beginnings of a solution to this problem,""
Marchionne said on an earnings conference call.
    Canadian officials say their U.S. counterparts have asked a
series of questions about how the plan would work. It is unclear
how U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will react to
the plan when he arrives in Montreal on Sunday.
    The current round of talks in Montreal is the penultimate in
the negotiations to update NAFTA.
    ""I think I'm more optimistic now than I have been in quite
some time, because we have an opportunity here for having a true
dialogue on what a 21st century rule of origin for NAFTA might
look like,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government
affairs at the Washington-based Motor and Equipment
Manufacturers Association.
    The industry fears that if North American content demands
are set too high, manufacturers will simply forego NAFTA's
tariff-free access and pay low 2.5 percent U.S. tariffs on parts
and passenger cars produced outside the region. The result could
be less automotive production in the United States, not more, 
industry representatives say.
    ""We're very appreciative of the Canadians putting forth some
fresh new ideas. It's a positive signal and hopefully a shift in
the talks,"" said Jennifer Thomas, vice president of federal
government affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers,
    Thomas, noting that U.S. domestic sales were expected to
decline after a seven-year run that set records, added, ""We're
kind of bracing for a downturn and we don't need to have any
additional burdens further harming the industry.""
    John Bozzella, president of the trade group Global
Automakers, said executives had pressed senior White House
officials about the importance of NAFTA.
    ""I think those meetings have been impactful. They have
gotten key players within the administration thinking about how
the industry can remain competitive going forward in a way they
hadn't before,"" he said.
    Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts
Manufacturers Association, said the Trump administration would
not be selling out its base by agreeing to focus on the value of
high-tech in autos.
    ""The science in specialized steel is as space ages as it is
in app writing for vehicle operation. They're smart enough to
know they do really well in both,"" he told reporters.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade
Commission on Friday said in an initial finding that imports of
aluminum alloy sheet metal from China harm U.S. producers,
allowing a U.S. probe to proceed into whether the product was
being dumped or unfairly subsidized.
    Employing a seldom-used tactic aimed at speeding up the
imposition of duties, the U.S. Commerce Department in November
""self-initiated"" anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations of
the imports, which are typically used in construction and in
transportation and electrical equipment.
    It estimated it would impose anti-dumping duties of about
56.54 percent to 59.72 percent in the case. [nL1N1NY251]
    About $603.6 million worth of the flat-rolled metal was
imported from China in 2016. The probe excludes aluminum used in
beverage can manufacturing.
    The unanimous vote was applauded by the Aluminum
Association, which represents U.S. aluminum producers and worked
with Commerce on the probe.
    ""U.S. companies that make common alloy aluminum sheet have
suffered extensive injury thanks to unfairly traded imports from
China for many years,"" the group's president, Heidi Brock, said
in a statement. 
    But the National Marine Manufacturers Association said the
decision was bad news for aluminum boat makers, a big part of a
$3 billion recreational boating industry that claims to support
650,000 U.S. jobs.
    ""The ruling is expected to significantly drive up the costs
of aluminum used to manufacture more than 111,000 boats such as
pontoons and fishing boats, which make up 43 percent of new
powerboat sales,"" NMMA President Thom Dammrich said in a
statement.  
    Earlier this week, U.S. aluminum products makers sought new
protections against Chinese aluminum shipped through Vietnam,
asking Commerce to investigate allegations that China Zhongwang
Holdings Ltd <1333.HK> is circumventing U.S. duties.
[nL1N1P502J]
    And next week, the Commerce Department is due to send the
White House the results of its investigation into whether rising
aluminum imports are threatening U.S. national security, a probe
likely to provide U.S. President Donald Trump with an
opportunity to levy broad tariffs or import quotas on aluminum.
    The results of a similar ""Section 232"" national security
probe into steel imports was given to Trump on Thursday night.
Commerce did not reveal its recommendations. [nL1N1P7038]
    China’s excess production capacity for both steel and
aluminum has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United
States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to
protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese
imports.

    GENEVA, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Donald Trump's view of world
trade will be challenged next week when he visits the World
Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, judging by a paper seen by
Reuters on Wednesday that is aimed squarely at his ""America
First"" stance.
    The ""Strategic Brief on Misconceptions around Trade
Balances"" issued by the WEF's network of trade experts did not
mention Trump by name. But it took issue with his
administration's understanding of international commerce.
    ""A widely held view is that a country's trade balance is a
key measure of its international commercial success,"" said
co-authors Harvard professor Robert Lawrence and Princeton
fellow Yeling Tan in the paper, which is due to be presented and
debated at Davos.
    ""Currently, invoking this reasoning, the administration is
seeking to reduce the trade deficit by renegotiating U.S. trade
agreements and adopting more protectionist U.S. policies."" 
    Trump has railed against the U.S. trade deficit with China,
hobbled the World Trade Organization by blocking judicial
appointments, pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade
talks and antagonised Canada and Mexico by demanding a revamp of
the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
    The Davos paper said Trump's administration believed
""unfair"" trade had led to large trade deficits and job losses,
but policies based on such thinking could end up harming the
people they aimed to help.
    The authors said similar narratives had also emerged in
other countries and regions but did not name them.  
    They set out seven examples of sloppy thinking on trade,
illustrated by graphs showing that the relationship between
imports and U.S. domestic employment had been ""overwhelmingly
positive"" and that larger U.S. trade deficits had been
associated with faster jobs growth. 
    The first example was that ""trade deficits are bad, trade
surpluses are good"". Both deficits and surpluses may be bad or
good, and the trade balance was a function of national saving
and investment, not trade policies. 
    Other examples were ""imports are the cause of the decline in
manufacturing jobs"" and ""trade agreements will increase the
deficit"".
     Trump's Jan. 26 speech at Davos comes as his administration
prepares for a penultimate round of NAFTA talks and as he
considers imposing broad restrictions on steel and aluminium
imports, a policy which is aimed at China but risks rebounding
on the European Union [nL1N1P80D8][nL5N1KA1K4].
    It was wrong to think that imposing a tax on imports would
create manufacturing jobs, the Davos paper said. 
    ""New barriers to trade could disrupt production and reduce
rather than increase domestic employment in both the protected
industries and those that use their outputs.""

background)
    By David Ljunggren and Allison Lampert
    MONTREAL, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Planemaker Bombardier Inc
<BBDb.TO> is expected to lose a hotly contested U.S. trade
dispute this week, a Canadian government source told Reuters on
Thursday, likely inflaming tensions between the two countries
during talks to modernize NAFTA.
    Trade lawyers and industry experts largely predict the
International Trade Commission (ITC) will back the U.S. Commerce
Department's recommendation to slap Bombardier's CSeries with a
near 300-percent duty on sales to American carriers on Friday.
    This is the first time a Canadian official has acknowledged
that is the most likely outcome.
    Boeing Co <BA.N>, the world's largest maker of jetliners,
accuses the Canadian firm of dumping the planes in the U.S.
market. An ITC spokeswoman declined to comment.
    ""We think Bombardier is going to lose because the process is
designed that way,"" said the Canadian source, who requested
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
    ""It is not a multilateral or independent or unbiased
tribunal. It's an American tribunal,"" the source added.
    Bombardier was not immediately available for comment.
    Other industry experts, however, argue the ITC could still
side with Bombardier, which has struck a deal with Airbus SE
<AIR.PA> to give the European planemaker a majority stake in the
CSeries. 
    The fate of the CSeries and the well-paid jobs associated
with the plane is important both to Ottawa and the British
government. The company is a big employer in Northern Ireland,
where a political party is helping keep Prime Minister Theresa
May in power.
    May spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday and
reiterated the importance of the Bombardier jobs in Northern
Ireland, her office said. [nL8N1PK6HP] 
    Amid anger over the Boeing challenge, Canada last year
scrapped plans to buy the planemaker's 18 Super Hornet fighter
jets. [nS0N1H300G]
    Boeing argues its business was hurt because Bombardier
received illegal government subsidies and dumped the CSeries
through the 2016 sale of 75 jets to Delta Air Lines <DAL.N>.
[nL1N1OK1QP]
    Bombardier says Boeing never used its smallest plane, the
737 MAX 7, to compete for the order. No C Series planes have
been delivered yet.
    ""How can you have an outcome that assesses injury when there
is no export even taking place?"" the Canadian source asked.
    Ottawa has yet to work out how it will react to the expected
ruling, the source added, citing the number of different actors
involved.
    The ITC is expected to make a decision on Friday. For
Bombardier to win, at least three of the body's four
commissioners would have to rule for the Canadian planemaker.

    OTTAWA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian government is sending
three cabinet ministers to the United States to stress the
merits of NAFTA, officials said on Thursday, paving the way for
key talks that could either sink or save the trade pact.
    Canada and Mexico object to major changes that Washington
wants to make to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and
time is running out to settle differences before the
negotiations are scheduled to wrap up at the end of March.
    Officials will hold the sixth and penultimate round of talks
in Montreal from Jan. 23-28. 
    Two Canadian cabinet ministers are already in the United
States and one more will travel this weekend.
    Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the
United States, has been reaching out to U.S. politicians and the
business community for almost two years to bolster support for
free trade. [nL1N1JP21B]
    ""We recognize we are heading into an important period. We
are certainly preparing for all scenarios, and we're hopeful
that we can make progress,"" a spokesman for Foreign Minister
Chrystia Freeland said when asked about the latest visits.
    ""That's what we're focused on achieving, including in
Montreal,"" Alex Lawrence, the spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.
    News releases announcing the ministerial trips make clear
the cabinet members have been instructed to ""promote trade and
NAFTA.""
    Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale wraps up a two-day trip
to Kentucky on Friday, the same day that Environment Minister
Catherine McKenna finishes a visit to San Francisco. Officials
initially indicated McKenna would travel this weekend but later

    Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay is due to visit
Tennessee from Friday to Monday.
    Canadian officials are increasingly pessimistic about the
prospects for the 1994 trade treaty, which U.S. President Donald
Trump blames for the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S.
manufacturing jobs and a big trade deficit with Mexico.
    Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing ""a level of
unpredictability that's out of our control,"" told Global
Television late last month that ""no deal is better than a bad
deal for Canadians.""
    In a meeting held in Washington last month between the fifth

subjects of the sourcing of auto parts, dispute settlement and

some concessions in Montreal, Trump will be more tempted to
issue a notice of withdrawal from NAFTA.

    * Says China extrusions converted in Vietnam, then shipped

 (Adds Zhongwang comment)
    WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum products makers
sought new trade protections against Chinese imports on Tuesday,
accusing China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd <1333.HK> and its
affiliates of evading U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties
by shipping aluminum products through Vietnam.
    In a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department, the Aluminum
Extruders Council said that aluminum extrusions from Zhongwang
were being shipped to affiliate Global Vietnam Aluminum Co Ltd
for conversion work before being exported to the United States.
    Duties on Chinese extrusions are currently a combined 106
percent, according to the Commerce Department.  
    In response, Zhongwang told Reuters that the ""allegations
made are without grounds"".
    The anti-circumvention petition follows a number of U.S.
actions to raise barriers to Chinese aluminum, including
Commerce Department preliminary duties on Chinese aluminum foil
and a rare U.S. government-initiated investigation into imports
of Chinese aluminum alloy sheet products. [nL1N1NY251] 
    It also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump is considering much broader global restrictions on
aluminum imports on national security grounds. 
    The Commerce Department is due to issue recommendations to
Trump from its ""Section 232"" investigation into aluminum imports
on Jan 22. Recommendations from a similar probe into steel
imports are due on Jan. 16, but it is not clear whether either
report will immediately be made public.
    China's excess production capacity of both metals has
emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and
Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic
industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports. 
    In the Vietnam petition, the Aluminum Extruders Council said
it provided evidence that Zhongwang's affiliate in Vietnam was
changing the shape and form of Chinese extrusions in minor ways
but claiming their origin as Vietnamese.
    ""These blatant attempts to evade duties and flood the market
with unfairly traded Chinese aluminum extrusions must be
halted,"" the trade group's president, Jeff Henderson, said in a
statement.
    In June, the Commerce Department ordered that fabricated
aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the
U.S. duties after determining that they were part of a duty
evasion scheme. The Aluminum Extruders Council argued that these
products are being shipped through Vietnam with minor changes.
    The Commerce Department has shown receptiveness to similar
anti-circumvention cases in the steel sector. In December, the
agency slapped steep duties on steel products from Vietnam that
originated as Chinese made hot-rolled steel. [nL1N1O52KU]

In a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department, the Aluminum Extruders Council said that aluminum extrusions from Zhongwang were being shipped to affiliate Global Vietnam Aluminum Co Ltd for conversion work before being exported to the United States. Duties on Chinese extrusions are currently a combined 106 percent, according to the Commerce Department. In response, Zhongwang told Reuters that the ""allegations made are without grounds"". The anti-circumvention petition follows a number of U.S. actions to raise barriers to Chinese aluminum, including Commerce Department preliminary duties on Chinese aluminum foil and a rare U.S. government-initiated investigation into imports of Chinese aluminum alloy sheet products. It also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering much broader global restrictions on aluminum imports on national security grounds. The Commerce Department is due to issue recommendations to Trump from its ""Section 232"" investigation into aluminum imports on Jan 22. Recommendations from a similar probe into steel imports are due on Jan. 16, but it is not clear whether either report will immediately be made public. China's excess production capacity of both metals has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports. In the Vietnam petition, the Aluminum Extruders Council said it provided evidence that Zhongwang's affiliate in Vietnam was changing the shape and form of Chinese extrusions in minor ways but claiming their origin as Vietnamese. ""These blatant attempts to evade duties and flood the market with unfairly traded Chinese aluminum extrusions must be halted,"" the trade group's president, Jeff Henderson, said in a statement. In June, the Commerce Department ordered that fabricated aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the U.S. duties after determining that they were part of a duty evasion scheme. The Aluminum Extruders Council argued that these products are being shipped through Vietnam with minor changes. The Commerce Department has shown receptiveness to similar anti-circumvention cases in the steel sector. In December, the agency slapped steep duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated as Chinese made hot-rolled steel.",aluminum products makers seek new trade protections chinese import tuesday accuse china zhongwang hold ltd 1333hk affiliate evade antidumping antisubsidy duties ship aluminum products vietnam file commerce department aluminum extruders council aluminum extrusions zhongwang ship affiliate global vietnam aluminum co ltd conversion work export unite state duties chinese extrusions currently combine 106 percent accord commerce department response zhongwang tell reuters allegations make without ground anticircumvention petition follow number action raise barriers chinese aluminum include commerce department preliminary duties chinese aluminum foil rare governmentinitiated investigation import chinese aluminum alloy sheet products also come administration consider much broader global restrictions aluminum import national security ground commerce department due issue recommendations section 232 investigation aluminum import jan 22 recommendations similar probe steel import due jan 16 clear whether either report immediately make public chinas excess production capacity metal emerge major trade irritant unite state europe prompt consider new step protect domestic industries job flood chinese import vietnam petition aluminum extruders council provide evidence zhongwangs affiliate vietnam change shape form chinese extrusions minor ways claim origin vietnamese blatant attempt evade duties flood market unfairly trade chinese aluminum extrusions must halt trade group jeff henderson statement june commerce department order fabricate aluminum pallets import china subject duties determine part duty evasion scheme aluminum extruders council argue products ship vietnam minor change commerce department show receptiveness similar anticircumvention case steel sector december agency slap steep duties steel products vietnam originate chinese make hotrolled steel

    By Tom Miles
    GENEVA, Jan 25 (Reuters) - South Korea has hit back rapidly
at U.S. tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, filing
challenges and demands for compensation at the World Trade
Organization.
    The WTO published the South Korean complaints on Thursday
two days after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the steep
tariffs into law. He billed the move as a way to protect
American jobs but the solar industry said it would lead to
thousands of layoffs and raise consumer prices. [nL2N1PI25M]
    The 30 percent tariff on solar panels was among the first
unilateral trade restrictions imposed by the Trump
administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda aimed
at helping U.S. manufacturers, but which has alarmed Asian
trading partners that produce lower cost goods. 
    South Korea challenged the U.S. tariffs under the WTO's
Safeguard Agreement, leaving open the possibility of a full
trade dispute later. [nS6N1M900H]
    The agreement gives the United States 30 days to settle the
matter, after which South Korea has a 60-day window to impose
trade sanctions, if the U.S. measures break WTO rules. It was
not clear if the United States could challenge that assumption.
    Seoul is already seeking WTO trade sanctions to retaliate
for Washington's failure to comply with an earlier WTO ruling.
[nL8N1P74NG]
    On Wednesday U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross brushed off
the threat of South Korea going to the WTO.
    “The fact that they may get a favourable decision (at the
WTO) doesn’t mean that it’s a correct decision,"" he said. ""But
in any event there’s been no decision yet so it’s a little bit
too early to assume that the safeguards will be knocked out.”
    No country has ever negotiated a settlement under the WTO
safeguard rules, and it was not clear if they could provide a
quicker result than a full dispute, which could take three years
or more, giving U.S. manufacturers a long period of protection
from competition by their South Korean rivals.
    Under WTO rules, a country can impose safeguards - temporary
emergency tariffs - to shield its domestic industry from an
sudden, unforeseen and damaging surge in imports. 
    Ricardo Meléndez-Ortiz, head of the International Centre for
Trade and Sustainable Development, said the solar tariffs would
fail to boost U.S. solar manufacturing and would destroy U.S.
jobs while impeding the fight against climate change. 
    ""These tariffs are insufficient to really generate enough
stimulus to create the manufacturing capacity that they are
trying to stimulate,"" he told Reuters. 
    ""It's just going to slow down the production of sustainable
energy and solar in the U.S., in a big way.""

    WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Qatar is expected to agree on
Tuesday to release detailed financial information about its
state-owned Qatar Airways, U.S. State Department officials said
late on Sunday, a move that follows pressure from U.S. airlines
for it to disclose any potential subsidies it has received.
    Under an understanding to be announced Tuesday, Qatar
Airways will issue audited financial reports within a year and
within two years must disclose significant new transactions with
state-owned enterprises, U.S. officials said.
    Qatar Airways and the Qatari government could not
immediately be reached late Sunday.
    The largest U.S. carriers - American Airlines Group Inc
<AAL.O>, United Continental Holdings Inc <UAL.N> and Delta Air
Lines Inc <DAL.N> - since 2015 have urged the U.S. government to
challenge the conduct of three major Middle Eastern carriers
under ""Open Skies"" agreements. The U.S. airlines contend the
Gulf carriers are being unfairly subsidized by their governments
with more than $50 billion in subsidies over the last decade.
    Qatar, Etihad Airways and Emirates, have denied those
accusations. The Gulf airlines operate around 200 flights per
week to 12 U.S. cities.
    Qatar and the United States are expected to disclose details
of the understanding on aviation issues at a U.S.-Qatar
strategic dialogue in Washington on Tuesday that will include
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary
James Mattis, along with senior Qatari officials, U.S. State
Department officials said. They spoke on the condition of
anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.
    The voluntary agreement follows extensive negotiations with
senior U.S. and Qatari officials in recent weeks. Qatar's Civil
Aviation authority told the U.S. government that Qatar Airways
has no current plans to offer so-called ""fifth freedom flights""
that allow an airline to fly between foreign countries as a part
of services to and from its home country.
    Qatar must take steps to ensure that the transactions are
conducted on commercial terms. The disclosures could help U.S.
carriers make the case that the airline is getting unfair
government subsidies.
    The voluntary agreement does not to apply to Etihad or
Emirates, both based in the United Arab Emirates. The State
Department plans new talks with UAE as early as next week, U.S.
officials said.
    In a Sept. 14 White House memo disclosed by Reuters and

the U.S. government “should take action to address the unfair
behavior of Gulf carriers.""

    Jan 24 (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc <066570.KS> will raise
prices of most of its washers in the United States after the
government announced steep tariffs on imported large residential
washing machines, according to a letter sent by LG to retailers.
    The tariffs will affect most front- and top-load type
washers, the South Korean company said in the letter, without
mentioning the magnitude of the price hikes.
    U.S. President Donald Trump approved recommendations to
impose safeguard tariffs on the washing machines as well as
solar cells and modules in a decision announced on Monday.
[nL2N1PH1UJ]
    The move followed findings by the U.S. International Trade
Commission that these imports were ""a substantial cause of
serious injury to domestic manufacturers.""
    A 20 percent tariff will apply on the first 1.2 million

    DETROIT, Jan 13 (Reuters) - General Motors Co <GM.N> Chief
Executive Mary Barra expressed optimism on Saturday that the
North American Free Trade Agreement would survive, and other
senior GM executives stood by the company's plans to continue
building trucks in Mexico.
    At an event to tout GM's 2019 Chevrolet Silverado pickup
truck ahead of the Detroit auto show, Barra twice did not answer
directly when asked if the automaker is reconsidering current
production in Mexico in light of potential changes or the
collapse of the trade deal between the United States, Canada and
Mexico.
    Company executives did not rule out future changes to its
North American production plans depending on the outcome of
ongoing NAFTA renegotiation talks, even though it would be
costly to shift production of trucks.
    Rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV<FCAU.N> <FCHA.MI> said on
Thursday it will move production of its next-generation
heavy-duty pickup trucks to Michigan from a plant in Mexico, a
move that reduces the risk that those trucks would be hit with a
25 percent tariff if NAFTA unravels.
    Barra sidestepped a question about GM's Mexican truck
factory, saying, ""When I look at our footprint, there is so much
more work and negotiations to be done on NAFTA.""
    Mark Reuss, GM's product development chief, said the company
is using its existing truck plants in North America, but would
not elaborate when asked if GM could stop building trucks in
Mexico. 
    ""I'm not sure that we would tell anybody that,"" Reuss said.
""I don't think we'd be talking about our footprint in the
future.""
    In a separate exchange with reporters, Reuss said GM
intended to use its North American factories, including those in
Mexico.
    Barra, who met in November with Vice President Mike Pence
along with other U.S. auto executives, said GM has been working
to educate the Trump administration about the complexities of
the auto industry and its supply base.
    ""We're going to continue to work constructively to get a
modernized NAFTA agreement,"" she said.
    Barra said she was optimistic that NAFTA would survive.
President Donald Trump has threatened to walk away from the 1994
accord unless major changes are made in negotiations with Mexico
and Canada.
    Other GM executives defended the company's North American
manufacturing strategy, saying 80 percent of the trucks sold in
the United States are made in U.S. factories.
    GM North America President Alan Batey said GM's Mexican
truck plant supports U.S. jobs.    
    ""The truck we build in Mexico, the engines come from the
U.S. Everything is interlinked,"" Batey told reporters after
showing off the new Silverado. [nL1N1P80GX]
    Asked what GM would do if the United States pulls out of
NAFTA, Batey said GM would ""have to worry about that when we get
there.""

    WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's
decision not to impose sanctions on Russia for now, under a law
overwhelmingly passed by Congress, represents a missed
opportunity to deter the Kremlin's aggressive behavior, former
U.S. officials and Russia specialists said on Tuesday.
    The Trump administration late on Monday said it would not
immediately impose sanctions under the law, designed to punish
Moscow for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Russia
denies doing so. [nL2N1PO20G]
    The administration also published a list of Russian
oligarchs who could be sanctioned, as required by the law.
    The list was dismissed in Moscow as little more than a
""telephone directory"" of the rich. U.S. and Russian observers
said it appeared to be a virtual copy of Forbes magazine's list
of Russia's wealthiest people. [nL8N1PP0MC]
    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Senate Banking
Committee on Tuesday that the administration could still impose
sanctions.
    ""This should in no way be interpreted as we’re not putting
sanctions on any of the people in that report,"" Mnuchin told the
Senate Banking Committee, referring to the list of oligarchs.
    Under the law, the administration faced a Monday deadline to
impose sanctions on anyone who was determined to have conducted
significant business with Russian defense and intelligence
sectors. Those sectors already have been sanctioned for their
alleged role in the U.S. presidential election.
    ""I think the administration missed an opportunity to extend
the use of sanctions"" to deter Russia, said retired ambassador
Daniel Fried, formerly the State Department's top sanctions
official.
    The report on Russian oligarchs ""seemed to be assembled in
haste, and seemed to be close to a cut-and-paste job,"" said
Fried, now at the Atlantic Council think tank.
    Trump criticized the sanctions law, which Congress passed
last year with enough backing to override any presidential veto,
and has seemed unenthusiastic about implementing it.
    In a statement late on Monday, State Department spokeswoman
Heather Nauert said the law by itself was deterring Russian
defense sales.
    ""Since the enactment of the ... legislation, we estimate
that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced
purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense
acquisitions,"" she said.
    While that explanation is ""not preposterous,"" said Lawrence
Freedman, emeritus professor at King's College London, ""the main
concern is clearly not wanting to upset Russia more.""
    Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said he was heartened by a
classified briefing that the State Department gave on Monday to
the committee's staff.
    ""I am encouraged by the diplomatic steps Secretary (of State
Rex) Tillerson has taken in recent months to compel other
governments to comply with CAATSA,"" Corker said, using an
acronym for the Countering America's Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act. ""On the whole, it is clear the administration is
working in good faith.""

this week to try and forge ahead with a trade pact that U.S.
President Donald Trump abandoned last year, the new 11-member
club risks getting bogged down by resistance from Canada.
     The member countries of the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP), also known as
TPP 11, reached a basic agreement on the pact in November.     
    But Canada is holding out to secure protection of its
cultural industries, like movies, TV, and music, and has said it
will not be rushed into signing a deal that other members hope
to conclude by March. 
    That is casting a shadow over a meeting of trade officials
from member countries this week in Tokyo and is raising
questions about the economic benefits of a pact that doesn't
bring Canada into the fold.
    ""The overall economic impact of the CPTPP would be
significantly further eroded if Canada, which is a Group of
Seven nation, decides to postpone its decision about joining,""
said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. 
     After Trump pulled the United States out of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement last year, Japan took a
leading role in pushing for a replacement pact. 
    Along with Australia and Mexico, Tokyo has lobbied hard for
the agreement, which aims to eliminate trading barriers and
tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation
bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion in 2016.[nL3N1NG5RV]
    ""Our strong preference is for all 11 countries to join the
first wave, but our focus is on bringing a new TPP agreement
into force as soon as possible with those who are ready to
move,"" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in Tokyo
last week. [nL3N1PD3BO]
    The talks in Tokyo starting Monday are expected to iron out
technical differences on rules for the treatment of labour and
intellectual property but unlikely to yield a conclusive
statement that member countries will quickly sign the pact.
    Canada, which would be the second-biggest economy in the
bloc after Japan, is also unhappy over the rules of origin for
cars.
    ""Like Vietnam, one of the crucial elements we secured was
what is known as a work plan, a mechanism to deal with
outstanding issues, which for Canada includes ensuring the deal
provides better access and terms for autos and does not affect
our unique cultural sensitivities,"" Joseph Pickerill, spokesman
for Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, said in
a statement.
    Vietnam has emerged as another swing country because of its
resistance to rules that would improve rights for its workforce,
although Hanoi hasn't shown resistance to sign the pact. 
    ""Canada has taken a step back to say they cannot sign TPP 11
right away, but there are expectations that if the remaining 10
countries move ahead Canada will eventually come back,"" said
Junichi Sugawara, senior research officer at Mizuho Research
Institute.

The member countries of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership , also known as TPP 11, reached a basic agreement on the pact in November. But Canada is holding out to secure protection of its cultural industries, like movies, TV, and music, and has said it will not be rushed into signing a deal that other members hope to conclude by March. That is casting a shadow over a meeting of trade officials from member countries this week in Tokyo and is raising questions about the economic benefits of a pact that doesn't bring Canada into the fold. ""The overall economic impact of the CPTPP would be significantly further eroded if Canada, which is a Group of Seven nation, decides to postpone its decision about joining,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit. After Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement last year, Japan took a leading role in pushing for a replacement pact. Along with Australia and Mexico, Tokyo has lobbied hard for the agreement, which aims to eliminate trading barriers and tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356 billion in 2016. ""Our strong preference is for all 11 countries to join the first wave, but our focus is on bringing a new TPP agreement into force as soon as possible with those who are ready to move,"" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in Tokyo last week. The talks in Tokyo starting Monday are expected to iron out technical differences on rules for the treatment of labour and intellectual property but unlikely to yield a conclusive statement that member countries will quickly sign the pact. Canada, which would be the second-biggest economy in the bloc after Japan, is also unhappy over the rules of origin for cars. ""Like Vietnam, one of the crucial elements we secured was what is known as a work plan, a mechanism to deal with outstanding issues, which for Canada includes ensuring the deal provides better access and terms for autos and does not affect our unique cultural sensitivities,"" Joseph Pickerill, spokesman for Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, said in a statement. Vietnam has emerged as another swing country because of its resistance to rules that would improve rights for its workforce, although Hanoi hasn't shown resistance to sign the pact. ""Canada has taken a step back to say they cannot sign TPP 11 right away, but there are expectations that if the remaining 10 countries move ahead Canada will eventually come back,"" said Junichi Sugawara, senior research officer at Mizuho Research Institute.",trade officials gather tokyo week try forge ahead trade pact abandon last year new 11member club risk get bogged resistance canada member countries comprehensive progressive agreement transpacific partnership also know tpp 11 reach basic agreement pact november canada hold secure protection cultural industries like movies tv music rush sign deal members hope conclude march cast shadow meet trade officials member countries week tokyo raise question economic benefit pact doesnt bring canada fold overall economic impact cptpp significantly erode canada group seven nation decide postpone decision join rajiv biswas asiapacific chief economist ihs markit pull unite state transpacific partnership agreement last year japan take lead role push replacement pact along australia mexico tokyo lobby hard agreement aim eliminate trade barriers tariff industrial farm products across 11nation bloc whose trade total 356 billion 2016 strong preference 11 countries join first wave focus bring new tpp agreement force soon possible ready move australian prime minister malcolm turnbull tokyo last week talk tokyo start monday expect iron technical differences rule treatment labour intellectual property unlikely yield conclusive statement member countries quickly sign pact canada secondbiggest economy bloc japan also unhappy rule origin cars like vietnam one crucial elements secure know work plan mechanism deal outstanding issue canada include ensure deal provide better access term autos affect unique cultural sensitivities joseph pickerill spokesman canadian trade minister francoisphilippe champagne statement vietnam emerge another swing country resistance rule improve right workforce although hanoi hasnt show resistance sign pact canada take step back cannot sign tpp 11 right away expectations remain 10 countries move ahead canada eventually come back junichi sugawara senior research officer mizuho research institute
nL1N1PD05O,"['NP:G', 'NP:M', 'NP:PGE', 'NP:PSC', 'NP:RNP', 'NP:T']","    MEXICO CITY, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Mexico and the European
Union should complete a new free trade deal ""within the next few
weeks,"" despite the fact there are still a few difficult areas
to agree on, a senior Mexican official said on Wednesday. 
    In a radio interview after the conclusion of the eighth
round of talks between Mexico and the EU, Mexico's deputy
economy minister, Juan Carlos Baker, said negotiations will
resume in the week beginning Feb. 5, with a quick end in sight.
    ""We're working to get this done within the next few weeks,""
he said. 
    The two parties are aiming to update their 2000 trade
accord, which covers industrial products, by adding farm
produce, government procurement and investment.
    They also want to demonstrate their embrace of open markets
as the United States turns inwards under President Donald Trump.
    For Mexico, a deal with the European Union would be part of
a strategy to reduce its reliance on the United States, the
destination for nearly 80 percent of its exports. This has
become even more urgent given Trump's threat to scrap the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
